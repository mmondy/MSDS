"Firefighter Mayo and Firefighter Smith responded with Engine Company 76, three other engines, two ladder companies, two chief officers, an ambulance, and support staff to the report of a fire in a McDonald’s restaurant.  The fire was reported at 4:30 a.m.  Engine Company 76 was comprised of a captain, a fire apparatus operator, and two firefighters.  Engine 76 was the first fire fighting unit on the scene 8 minutes later and reported 6-foot flames visible from the roof.  The flames appeared as if they might be venting from an exhaust fan, possibly indicating a grease fire.

The captain ordered his firefighters to advance an attack line into the interior of the structure for fire control.  No fire was visible in the interior of the restaurant.  The firefighters from Engine 76 were joined by other firefighters who also advanced attack lines to the interior.  At 4:52 a.m., the incident commander ordered all firefighters out of the building in order to transition to a defensive attack mode.  The flames visible from the roof had grown to 30 feet in height, and fire had become visible in the kitchen area of the restaurant.

Moments later, the captain from Engine 76 concluded that his firefighters were missing and notified the incident commander.  A second alarm was requested at 5:02 a.m. and rescue attempts were begun.  A number of rescue attempts were made.

At 5:27 a.m., the incident commander struck a third alarm.  Shortly thereafter, a ladder company opened the rear door of the restaurant and made access to the back of the kitchen area.  A PASS device had been heard alarming in the kitchen area, and a firefighter was able to see a downed firefighter as he looked into the back door.  Firefighter Mayo was discovered with his facepiece in-place, his regulator not connected to the facepiece, and with his SCBA partially removed and entangled in wires.  He was removed, treated at the scene, in the ambulance, and at the hospital.  Despite these efforts, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Given the amount of time that had passed and the likelihood that Firefighter Smith was buried in debris, the search effort transitioned into a recovery mode.  Firefighter Smith was found at approximately 7:13 a.m. within 6 feet of the rear door of the restaurant.  She was entangled in wires and a pair of wire cutters were found near her body.  She was wearing an SCBA but the status of her facepiece and regulator could not be determined.
Both firefighters died of asphyxia due to smoke inhalation.  Firefighter Mayo’s carboxyhemoglobin level was found to be 26 percent and the level for Firefighter Smith was found to be 52 percent.

The fire was intentionally set by a group of juveniles attempting to conceal a burglary attempt.  Four individuals were convicted of crimes with sentences ranging from 2 to 35 years.

"District Chief Sterenchuk was in his office performing administrative duties.   He had not been feeling well an hour prior and had asked the department’s EMS coordinator to take his blood pressure.  His blood pressure was high, and he was also complaining of an ache in his right elbow similar to carpal tunnel pain.  He agreed to have his blood pressure checked later.

The department’s EMS coordinator, a captain, later walked past District Chief Sterenchuk’s office and noticed that he was having difficulty breathing.  The captain directed a staff member to call 9-1-1 and retrieved medical equipment from a reserve fire apparatus that was in the same building.  

Despite immediate advanced life support medical aid by firefighters and ambulance personnel, District Chief Sterenchuk succumbed to a heart attack.

"Firefighter/EMT Bryant and members of his department were dispatched to the report of a residential fire.  Upon arrival, Firefighter/EMT Bryant’s captain reported a working fire with flames and smoke visible from the garage.  The captain ordered his firefighters to extinguish the fire in the garage, and the fire was knocked down within 5 minutes of their arrival on-scene.

The captain then instructed Firefighter/EMT Bryant and another firefighter to enter the structure with a hoseline to search for victims, fire extension, and to begin to ventilate the structure.  The firefighters were met with dark smoke but no visible flame when they entered the structure.  They began a left hand search and proceeded to the second floor of the structure.  The second floor contained bedrooms and was directly above the garage.  A lieutenant joined the firefighters on the second floor by following the hoseline.  As the firefighters searched the bedrooms, there was a rapid buildup of heat.  A red glow was visible at the bottom of the stairs, cutting off the team’s escape route.  The decision was made to follow the hoseline back out of the structure since the firefighters were unsure about the presence of windows in the bedrooms and the stairway was small.  Firefighter/EMT Bryant was the last in line as the firefighters made their way to safety.

As the firefighters emerged from the house, the lieutenant removed his facepiece and told other firefighters that Firefighter/EMT Bryant was supposed to be right behind him but had not exited the structure with him.  The incident commander ordered an accountability report and it was discovered that Firefighter/EMT Bryant was missing.  A second crew of firefighters entered the residence through the front door but could not climb the stairs because they appeared to be collapsed and were heavily involved in fire.  The incident commander ordered a ladder raised to provide firefighters with access to a roof area which led to the bedroom windows.  Two firefighters entered the second floor of the structure and searched two bedrooms.  A sound believed to be Firefighter/EMT Bryant’s PASS device was located but turned out to be a smoke alarm.

The firefighters saw a light in the bedroom across the hall and found that it was a flashlight that was carried by Firefighter/EMT Bryant.  Firefighter/EMT Bryant was found on his knees on the floor with his facepiece removed.  His SCBA cylinder was found to be empty and his protective hood was found over his mouth and nose, most likely in an attempt to filter air to breathe.  His PASS device was found in the ""off"" position.  Firefighter/EMT Bryant was removed by firefighters through a window and lowered to the ground into the care of waiting paramedics.

Firefighter/EMT Bryant received aggressive resuscitation efforts at the scene, in the ambulance, and in a hospital emergency room, to no avail.  Firefighter/EMT Bryant was pronounced dead in the emergency room.  The cause of death was later listed as smoke and soot inhalation and acute carbon monoxide poisoning.  Firefighter/EMT Bryant’s blood carboxyhemoglobin level was found to be 25 percent at the time of his death.  This level does not actually reflect the level that had been present in his blood since the level was reduced by resuscitation efforts.

Firefighter/EMT Bryant was a career firefighter in Ogden, Utah.  Two other firefighters were injured.  The fire was caused by a droplight that had been hung near a cardboard box that was being used as part of a dog’s bed.

"Forestry Technician Y'Barbo was participating in the controlled (prescribed) burn of a 35-acre block of mature pine forest, with low understory vegetation.  Forestry Technician Y'Barbo was operating a 1985 Honda 250 All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), which had been procured by the Forest Service as Federal government property.  The ATV had a shop-made holder at the rear that accommodated a drip torch.  Forestry Technician Y'Barbo was wearing brush gear.

As Forestry Technician Y'Barbo ascended an incline while riding the ATV, the vehicle overturned backward.  As Forestry Technician Y'Barbo struggled to free himself, he accidentally kicked off the cap on the ATV's fuel tank.  Fuel splashed on Forestry Technician Y'Barbo and was quickly ignited by the drip torch.

Other firefighters quickly came to Forestry Technician Y'Barbo's aid, and he was transported to a hospital to undergo burn treatment.  Despite the efforts of his fellow firefighters and hospital personnel, Forestry Technician Y'Barbo died on April 7, 2000.  The cause of death was listed as complications of thermal injuries.

An Accident Review and Mitigation Report prepared by the Forest Service recommended that all Forest Service ATVs be equipped with threaded caps (the cap on Forestry Technician Y'Barbo's ATV was only equipped with a quarter-turn cap); fuel tank venting and overflow tubes; operator training, equipping supervisors with first aid kits that include fire blankets; the consideration of replacement of older, narrow track ATVs; and the installation of rollover protection on ATVs.

"Firefighter/Training Officer Griffith and members of his department were called to the scene of a grass fire.  The fire started when salvage workers ignited grass and nearby wood as they worked to dismantle two old, rusting 12,000-gallon elevated fuel storage tanks.  The grass fire was extinguished, and the salvage workers decided to use a blowtorch to cut a small hole near the drain of the tank that had already been pulled to the ground.  The hole was intended to allow the attachment of a tow chain, which would be used to pull the tank to a salvage yard.  As the hole was being made with a blowtorch, the tank emitted a hissing sound and suddenly exploded.  

Firefighter/Training Officer Griffith was killed instantly when he was struck by flying debris.   The cause of death was listed as multiple blunt trauma.

The top of the tank, which was torn away in the explosion and weighed over 900 pounds, flew over 114 feet before coming to rest.  A salvage worker was also killed, eight firefighters and a civilian received injuries.  Analysis of the tank contents revealed that the tank contained residual gasoline and other petroleum products.

"Captain Maisano and members of his fire department responded to a report of smoke in a residential structure.  After removing the contents of the fireplace and checking the attic and roof of the structure, it was determined that smoke was escaping the chimney in the attic and causing the smoke buildup.  Firefighters were stowing equipment in preparation for their return to the station.  Captain Maisano was attaching an elastic cord to secure a ground ladder to the truck when the cord snapped and struck him in the face.  Captain Maisano fell to the ground from a height of approximately 9 feet, fracturing a wrist and causing severe back pain.

Captain Maisano was transported to the hospital by ambulance.  He was treated there for 3 days and was discharged.  He was unable to sleep in bed due to pain, so he slept in an easy chair located in his home on the night that he was released from the hospital, April 7th.  He was last known to be alive at approximately 2:30 a.m. on April 8th, but was discovered dead by his wife in the morning.

The autopsy attributed his death to pneumonia.  The autopsy also noted that the use of multiple prescribed pain relief medications may have initiated an element of respiratory depression.

"Firefighter Baughn and 30 other members of his department were participating in search and rescue training in the basement of an office building.  Teams of two firefighters, equipped with structural protective clothing and SCBA, were doing crawl through searches in areas that were obscured with nontoxic smoke.  After completing an exercise that lasted approximately 20 minutes, Firefighter Baughn sat in a basement hallway, removed his SCBA facepiece, rested, and waited for other firefighters to complete the exercise.

When the other firefighters emerged from the exercise, Firefighter Baughn began to climb the stairs from the basement to the ground level of the building.   As he reached the first landing in the stairwell, Firefighter Baughn suddenly collapsed.  Firefighters found Firefighter Baughn pulseless and gasping for air.  CPR was started immediately and an ambulance was called to the scene.

Arriving ambulance personnel from the local ambulance squad began ALS treatment but were unable to deliver a shock to Firefighter Baughn through their defibrillator.  Firefighter Baughn was transported immediately to the closest hospital, a 2-minute ambulance ride away from the training site.  Resuscitation efforts were continued in the emergency room for 30 minutes until Firefighter Baughn was pronounced dead.

The cause of death was listed as Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) – acute cardiac arrhythmia.  Firefighter Baughn had a history of high blood pressure.  He took two medications for this disease, but did not take them regularly.

The energy selector for the defibrillator was found to be in the ""0"" mode.  The defibrillator will not deliver a shock unless an energy level greater than zero for the shock is selected.  Additional defibrillator training was recommended for squad members.

"Firefighter/Paramedic Davis and members of his department were dispatched to a report of a fire in a single-family residential structure that included a full basement.  Upon arrival, firefighters found heavy smoke showing from the structure and found that the fire was in the basement.  Firefighters attempted to reach the fire through the garage door (which opened into the basement) but were unsuccessful in locating the seat of the fire.  A positive-pressure fan was placed at the garage door.  Another team of three firefighters, including Firefighter/Paramedic Davis, advanced an attack line through the front door of the residence.  On their initial entry into the residence, they were unable to locate any fire.  The crew withdrew, found that a positive-pressure fan had been placed at the front door, and returned to explore another area of the house.

Firefighter/Paramedic Davis was at the nozzle as the hoseline was advanced into the second entry on the main floor of the residence.  As the line was advanced, Firefighter/Paramedic Davis fell through the floor into the area of the basement that was involved in fire.  Other firefighters helped Firefighter/Paramedic Davis as he attempted to jump back to the first floor from the basement but his efforts were unsuccessful.  Firefighters attempted to lower a scuttle hole ladder into the hole but the location of the hole and the sagging of the first floor into the basement prevented its use.  Firefighters instructed Firefighter/Paramedic Davis to use the hoseline to protect himself as they attempted to rescue him through the basement.

An attack team entered the basement and fought their way to the room that contained Firefighter/Paramedic Davis.  He was removed from the basement and received ALS medical treatment immediately.  He was transported by ground and air ambulances to a hospital in nearby Birmingham.  He was treated in the emergency room but was pronounced dead.

The cause of death was listed as hyperthermia (thermal injuries).  The carboxyhemoglobin level that was found in Firefighter/Paramedic Davis’ blood was less than 5 percent.  He was burned over roughly one-third of his body.

It is estimated that 12 to 15 minutes passed from the time Firefighter/Paramedic Davis fell into the basement until he was located and removed from the structure.  Firefighter/Paramedic Davis was the first firefighter fatality for Center Point Fire/Rescue.

"Smokejumper Liston was participating in mandatory annual recertification practice parachute jumps in preparation for the upcoming wildland season.  He had completed three jumps.  During the fourth jump of the day, Smokejumper Liston’s parachute failed, and he plunged 3,000 feet to his death.  Emergency medical care was provided immediately by other smokejumpers trained as emergency medical technicians to no avail.  Smokejumper Liston’s cause of death was listed as multiple impact (deceleration) injuries.  All smokejumping activities in Alaska and Idaho were halted for over 2 months as this incident was investigated.

The investigation revealed that the parachute malfunction was characterized as a ""drogue in tow"" meaning that the drogue chute deployed but did not release on demand in order to deploy Smokejumper Liston’s main parachute.  Smokejumper Liston then followed emergency procedures and manually deployed his reserve parachute.  During this action, the reserve pilot chute became entangled with the drogue bridle (the line which attaches the drogue to the main parachute) thereby preventing both the main and reserve canopies from deploying.

Smokejumper Liston was the first parachute-related fatality for the Bureau of Land Management in 40 years.

"Assistant Chief Blankenship and other members of his department were participating in a training/demolition burn of a two-and one-half story wood frame dwelling.

According to the fire chief, the plan for the day was to do small, one room burns to evaluate a saw, and then to completely burn the house.  After a series of small fires were extinguished on the first floor of the house, preparations were made for the demolition burn.

The plan for the final fire was to ignite the attic, then ignite the first floor, evacuate the house, and allow it to burn completely.  Water curtain nozzles were set up on the exterior of the house to protect trees that were in the proximity of the house.  Assistant Chief Blankenship went into the attic of the house and used a small garden-type sprayer to distribute diesel fuel in the attic.  As fires were ignited inside an attic room, Assistant Chief Blankenship used the sprayer to ""accelerate"" the fire.  With the exception of Assistant Chief Blankenship, all firefighters had left the attic space and were proceeding to the first floor of the structure.  A firefighter waiting at the base of the attic stairs for Assistant Chief Blankenship noted fire and smoke coming from the attic.  When firefighters reached the exterior of the structure, they notified the fire chief that Assistant Chief Blankenship was missing and possibly trapped.

As some firefighters attempted to suppress the fire, other firefighters used a ground ladder to access the second floor of the house in an attempt to rescue Assistant Chief Blankenship.  After several attempts, firefighters followed the sound of an activated PASS device and were able to reach Assistant Chief Blankenship.  They were unable to remove him as portions of the collapsed roof covered him.  Mutual aid firefighters arrived and were able to locate and remove Assistant Chief Blankenship about an hour after the time he was reported missing.  He was obviously deceased.  The cause of death was later listed as asphyxiation and burns.

A Major Incident Response Team from the State Fire Marshal’s Office conducted a thorough review of the incident.  The review concluded that there were several contributing factors to Assistant Chief Blankenship’s death.  The factors listed were:

Assistant Chief Blankenship remained in the attic too long, despite the urging of at least two other firefighters to exit the attic due to deteriorating fire conditions
The initiation of several fires simultaneously in the west playroom and the south wing by orders of Assistant Chief Blankenship.

The confined space of the attic construction caused the unstable conditions in the attic resulting in raising the ambient temperature; thereby causing volatile conditions in the room where the firefighters were present.

The use of atomized diesel fuel through a garden sprayer by Assistant Chief Blankenship directly on a free burning fire in the south wing of the attic resulted in the flash fire that enveloped the attic, and ultimately claimed his life.

"Lieutenant Brannon responded with his engine company to a report of a structure fire in a residence.  Lieutenant Brannon was part of a crew of three that responded on his company.  Arriving companies found a working fire on the first and second floors of a 1½ -story wood frame house.  Lieutenant Brannon took command of the incident and ordered an attack line through the front door.  After completing a 360-degree walk around the involved structure, Lieutenant Brannon assisted with the deployment and advancement of a second attack line.  The line was stretched to the first floor of the house and was used to control hot spots.  Lieutenant Brannon noticed an air leak on his SCBA.  The leak was controlled by another firefighter inside the house, but Lieutenant Brannon found that he was out of air and needed a new cylinder.

Lieutenant Brannon exited the house, spoke momentarily with the fire chief, and proceeded to his apparatus to get his cylinder changed.  He kneeled at the truck to allow the driver/operator to replace his cylinder.  The driver/operator asked Lieutenant Brannon if he was okay, Lieutenant Brannon responded that he needed a new cylinder, turned his head, and collapsed.

Other firefighters and on-scene paramedics immediately came to Lieutenant Brannon’s aid.  Lieutenant Brannon’s personal protective equipment was removed and ALS care was initiated.  He was defibrillated several times on the scene and was transported to a local hospital by the Bluefield Rescue Squad.  Lieutenant Brannon was revived in the emergency room but died on May 4, 2000.

"Captain Wilmot was a fire investigator working on the scene of a previous structure fire.  As Captain Wilmot and another fire investigator worked on the scene, Captain Wilmot caught his foot on an object and fell forward onto his chest, landing on a concrete walkway.  The day of the incident was Captain Wilmot’s 47th birthday.

After being helped up by the other fire investigator, Captain Wilmot said that he had fallen on his camera.  The lens of the camera had created an impression on his torso.  Captain Wilmot told the other fire investigator that he thought he had bruised a rib.

"Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett and a forester from the wood products company that owned the land that was on fire were teamed together.  The assignment for the pair was to use a tractor-plow (operated by Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett) to cut a fire break to tie in the rear and contain the right flank of the fire.  As the tractor-plow worked, the brush between the tractor line and the burned area was set ablaze by the forester using a drip torch so that future spread could be prevented.

The backfire became too intense, so the decision was made to stop the backfire part of the operation.  As the forester continued to follow the tractor-plow, he encountered a bee’s nest that had been plowed through by the tractor-plow.  The forester, who was allergic to bee stings, made attempts to get through the area but was forced to return to the road to avoid them.

About the same time, Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett made a turn toward the fire in an attempt to locate the perimeter.  Visibility was poor due to intense undergrowth and smoke.  He inadvertently positioned himself in front of a finger of the fire that was making a rapid run.  By the time he saw the crowning head fire rolling toward him, it was too late for a retreat.  He used his dozer to create a safety zone.  He laid face down in the center and covered himself with dirt in an attempt to protect himself as the fire passed over him. Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett was exposed for about 15 seconds. Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett rose from the ground, extinguished a small fire involving his tractor-plow, and drove the tractor-plow out to a point where he met some other firefighters.  He sustained second and third degree burns to his arms, back, neck, and face.

Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett was transported to a local hospital by a local police chief and later transferred to a burn center where he was treated for his injuries.  He died suddenly and unexpectedly on September 3, 2000, two weeks after his injury.  The cause of death was listed as massive bilateral bronchial pneumonia as the result of thermal burns with hospital immobilization.

Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett was either not equipped with or failed to use a fire shelter.  The County Chief Medical Examiner’s statement strongly recommended that all Mississippi Forestry Commission wildland crews be equipped with appropriate fire retardant/resistant protective clothing.  The medical examiner stated that Forestry Crew Chief Pritchett would likely not have sustained his specific burn injuries had he been wearing protective equipment.

The County Line fire eventually consumed 288 acres.  This fire and several others in the area were caused by arson.

"Firefighter Paramedic Yahraus was participating as a SWAT-medic member of a police SWAT team.  The team was practicing high-risk traffic stops.  Firefighter Paramedic Yahraus was the driver of one of the police vehicles used in the simulation and was standing on the driver’s side of his car after the stop had been made.  Another officer, who was playing the role of the suspect in this situation, exited his vehicle and then turned and fired a single shot at the officers who were acting in the role of police officers.  The weapon used was a 38-caliber pistol loaded with blanks.  The firing of the blank dislodged a lead plug that was installed in the barrel of the training weapon.  The lead plug broke the windshield, ricocheted off the window post, and struck Firefighter Paramedic Yahraus in the left eye area.

Officers began to provide first aid to Firefighter Paramedic Yahraus while EMS resources were summoned.  Upon their arrival, Sarasota County paramedic firefighters provided ALS care and transported Firefighter Paramedic Yahraus to a helicopter landing site for his trip to the hospital.

An investigation revealed that blank cartridges should not have been used in the training weapon.  Gas expelled by the blank when it is fired and debris such as wadding that is in the blank can create pressure and force the lead plug out of the gun.  The proper cartridge for use in the training weapon would have been a primer round.

Two firefighters, including Firefighter McCormick as the passenger, mounted the truck and headed for a fuel station.  On the way, the apparatus stalled and could not be restarted.  Firefighter McCormick radioed the fire station, told them about their vehicle trouble, and requested assistance.  Other firefighters brought another fire truck and the chief's pickup to the location of the broken truck.  After the truck was removed from the roadway, an attempt was made to boost or jump start the fire truck using the chief's vehicle.  When this failed, it was decided that the broken truck would be towed back to the station by the other fire truck.  The chains needed for the job were aboard the other fire truck.  At this time, the broken truck and the chief's vehicle were off the road and the fire truck that was to tow the broken truck back to the station was parked across the street due to construction in the area.  The area was dark, and the four-way flashers on the chief's vehicle and the working fire truck were in operation.

Firefighter McCormick began to cross the road to retrieve the chains.  Firefighter McCormick signaled to an approaching minivan to stop.

"Lieutenant Talley and Firefighter McKean responded with members of their fire department to a report of a basement fire in a single-story residence.  Upon their arrival on the scene, firefighters searched the basement for fire and found none.  The search was continued on the first floor and again, nothing was found.  Firefighters returned to the basement with a thermal-imaging camera and a hoseline.  A small fire was discovered and firefighters began extinguishment.

The basement ceiling was pulled and a wave of heat and smoke descended on the five firefighters in the basement, including Lieutenant Talley and Firefighter McKean.  Fire had been burning for some time in the concealed space between the basement ceiling and the first floor and fire now spread rapidly to the basement.  Three firefighters were able to escape the basement immediately but Lieutenant Talley and Firefighter McKean were trapped.

Firefighter McKean was not heard from after the rapid fire progression.  Lieutenant Talley was in communication with the incident commander and relayed the fact that he was low on air and that his exit path had been cut off by fire progress.

"Assistant Chief Kobierowski was the driver of a 1,000-gallon pumper/tanker that was responding to a garage fire.  As the apparatus neared the scene, the vehicle began to fishtail.  Assistant Chief Kobierowski overcorrected and the right rear wheels of the apparatus went off the road.  The vehicle traveled into the opposing lane of traffic, and Assistant Chief Kobierowski overcorrected again.  The apparatus left the right side of the road, rolled onto the driver’s side, and collided into a tree.  Impact with the tree crushed the cab roof of the apparatus down to the dashboard and seats.  The trunk diameter of the tree was approximately 36 inches.

Responders on the scene of the structure fire witnessed the crash and ran to the scene to render aid.  Assistant Chief Kobierowski and another firefighter were trapped in the cab.  The windshield of the apparatus was removed, and the winch from an electrical utility service truck was used to remove the tree and to pull the roof of the cab open to allow access to the injured firefighters.  Assistant Chief Kobierowski was removed and found to have a massive head injury.  The other firefighter received minor injuries.

CPR was begun on Assistant Chief Kobierowski and continued on-scene for approximately 20 minutes until he was pronounced dead.

The law enforcement report on the crash cited excessive speed and icy conditions as contributing to the incident.  Neither Chief Kobierowski nor the passenger in the pumper/tanker were wearing seat belts.

"On Wednesday, March 14, 2001, a report of a debris fire was received by the Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center.  The caller reported fire in a pile of debris at the rear of a hardware store.  An engine company was dispatched to the fire reported by the caller.

Based on the volume and nature of the smoke he was seeing as he drove through his district, Battalion 3 ordered additional fire department resources dispatched to assist.  Battalion 3 also responded to the incident.

The unit that is normally closest to the fire location is Engine 14.  Engine 14 became available after the dispatch of the initial units.  The captain of Engine 14 added his unit to the incident by computer and informed Battalion 3 of their arrival on the scene. 

Battalion 3 ordered Engine 14’s crew to enter businesses that back up to the debris fire to evacuate occupants and to determine if fire had spread to the inside of these businesses.  Engine 14’s crew searched a barber shop that was adjacent to a supermarket, found it to be unoccupied and clear of fire, and moved on to the next business - the supermarket.

When they entered the supermarket, Engine 14’s crew found only light smoke at the ceiling of the main store.  The crew moved through the building and entered a storage area.  They found heavy smoke and moderate heat in the storage area.  They reported this fact to Battalion 3 and went back to the front of the store to get a hoseline from another unit that had arrived at the front of the store.  A hoseline was extended to the storage room, and water was applied to the fire.  Visibility in the storage area was near zero and the ability to see in the supermarket deteriorated quickly.

Firefighter Tarver, a member of the Engine 14 crew, told his captain that he was running low on air in his SCBA and needed to leave the building.  The captain gathered his crew together and told them to follow the hoseline out to the exterior.  

As the two Engine 14 firefighters, including Firefighter Tarver, turned to leave, they became disoriented and ran into a wall.  They got back up, turned in the direction that they thought was the correct way to go, and ran into another wall.  Somehow both firefighters ended up in the rear portion of the main supermarket space.  Firefighter Tarver called for help on his radio.   The firefighter who was with Firefighter Tarver became separated from him and later exited the building with the assistance of other firefighters. 

The Engine 14 captain emerged from the building and looked for the other members of his crew, as well as the engineer of Engine 14.  Battalion 3 could see that fire was developing in the supermarket and began to order crews out of the building.  Firefighter Tarver heard these radio transmissions and repeated his call for help.

The Engine 14 captain heard Firefighter Tarver’s request for help and he notified Battalion 3 that he had two firefighters that were unaccounted for.  The Engine 14 captain quickly spoke to the captain of another crew and told him to follow Engine 3’s line to Firefighter Tarver’s last known location.

The captain and two firefighters entered the building immediately and followed the hoseline.  Visibility in the supermarket had dropped to zero.  They came upon Firefighter Tarver.  He was lost, out of air, standing on his feet, and calling for help.  The captain brought Firefighter Tarver down to the hose line and instructed him to follow it to the exterior.  Firefighter Tarver had become incapacitated by the smoke and did not obey the instructions of the captain.  Firefighter Tarver crawled a short distance, then stood up, turned, and disappeared in the smoke.  The captain and his firefighters were low on air at this point and had to leave the building.

When Battalion 3 heard that there were two Engine 14 firefighters missing, he immediately activated two Rapid Intervention Crews (RIC’s).  An engine crew and a ladder crew entered the supermarket with extra breathing air equipment to search for Firefighter Tarver and the other firefighter from Engine 14.  While the RIC crews were unable to locate the Engine 14 firefighters, they did remove other firefighters from the building.  As they left the supermarket, the interior of the supermarket became fully involved with fire.  Further entry from their direction was impossible.

After much effort, Firefighter Tarver was located and moved into a large storage room.  The crew that discovered Firefighter Tarver was relieved by a series of other crews that moved Firefighter Tarver, with great difficulty, to the exit of the supermarket storage room.

The movement of Firefighter Tarver was made extremely difficult by the smoke conditions in the storage room, the water that was falling as a result of fire suppression efforts, the heat of the fire, and obstacles that blocked the path to the exit and caught on Firefighter Tarver’s clothing and protective equipment.  His removal was further complicated by falling debris, the limited air supply in the firefighters’ breathing apparatus, and Firefighter Tarver’s physical size.

Firefighter Tarver was transported to the hospital by ambulance but all efforts to revive him on the scene, in the ambulance, and at the hospital were futile.  The cause of death was listed as thermal burns and smoke inhalation.  Firefighter Tarver’s carboxyhemoglobin level was 61%.

"Firefighter Ellison and members of his department were dispatched to a report of a structural fire in a residence with persons trapped.  As firefighters approached the scene, smoke was visible.  Upon their arrival, firefighters reported heavy black smoke and moderate fire coming through the left front side of the building.

The first-arriving crew forced entry through the front door of the residence and found two bedrooms with fire involvement.  The first floor of the structure was searched, and fire in the bedrooms was controlled with a handline.  There was still a significant amount of fire in the attic, and the incident commander gave the order to evacuate the building.  An exterior attack was made on the fire with handlines and a master stream.

After the fire was knocked down, three firefighters, including Firefighter Ellison, made entry into the first floor.  One firefighter was forced to leave due to difficulties with his SCBA.  Firefighter Ellison was on the nozzle.  As the firefighters pulled walls and applied water, they moved through a first-floor hallway.  A soft spot in the floor was noted as firefighters worked their way down the hall.  An additional group of firefighters were working to control a fire in the basement.  Firefighter Ellison and the other firefighter working with him agreed that conditions were worsening on the first floor and that they needed to leave the structure.  As they turned to exit, Firefighter Ellison fell through the soft spot in the floor into the basement.

The firefighter that had been working with Firefighter Ellison attempted to reach down through the hole and pull Firefighter Ellison back to the first floor.  After four unsuccessful attempts, the firefighter left the building and alerted other firefighters to the situation.  Further attempts were made to pull Firefighter Ellison from the hole, but crews were unable to complete the task.  A portable ladder was placed into the hole to facilitate rescue, but smoke and fire conditions would not allow it to be used.  In the course of these attempts, Firefighter Ellison’s gloves came off.

Three crews entered the basement through the rear of the structure in an attempt to reach Firefighter Ellison.  Two handlines were advanced, and the basement fire was knocked down.  Firefighter Ellison was found in a seated position; his helmet was off and his hood was pulled back.  Firefighter Ellison’s facepiece was in-place and he was breathing.  Firefighters removed him from the building, and his protective clothing was removed.  Medical care was provided on-scene, and Firefighter Ellison was flown to a regional medical facility.

Firefighter Ellison sustained second and third degree burns to 60% of his body, including his hands, head, chest, back, and legs.  Intensive medical care was provided at the hospital, but he was not able to respond and died of complications from his thermal burns on March 20, 2001.

Firefighter Ellison was a part-time firefighter with the Miami Township Fire Department and a full-time career firefighter with the Anderson Township Fire Department.

Upon his arrival, the Fire Chief observed a glow from the basement, heavy smoke conditions, and fire visible from the rear kitchen windows.  A car parked in front of the house and reports from neighbors that the house was occupied led the Chief to believe that rescue was needed.

Upon the arrival of the first engine company, the Chief ordered two firefighters to enter the rear of the structure to perform a primary search of the structure.  Firefighter Heenan was first through the door.  As soon as he entered the kitchen, the floor collapsed into the basement.  Firefighter Heenan, who was wearing full protective clothing and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), fell into the burning basement.

Rescue efforts were begun immediately by firefighters who entered the basement through an outside door.  Firefighter Heenan was located immediately, but his removal was delayed by the fact that Firefighter Heenan was trapped under the debris of the kitchen that had fallen into the basement.  Firefighters were assisted in locating Firefighter Heenan by the sounding of his Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) device.  Firefighter Heenan was conscious and guided rescuers.

After significant efforts lasting approximately 20 minutes, Firefighter Heenan was removed from the structure.  Advanced Life Support (ALS) medical care was provided, and he was transported to the hospital.  Firefighter Heenan had severe burns over 74% of his body.  He was conscious and alert upon his arrival at the hospital.  

Firefighter Heenan underwent at least nine surgeries related to his injuries including the amputation of his hands.  His condition progressively worsened and he died on March 25, 2001.   Firefighter Heenan’s family was at his side at the time of his death.

"Members of the Unionville Volunteer Fire Company responded to perform a body recovery of a kayaker who had drowned and become trapped under water about 20 feet from shore in 15 feet of water.  The department responded to the request of officials at the McConnell’s Mills State Park.

After arrival on-scene and an assessment of several recovery scenarios, Assistant Chief Murdick and Firefighter/Paramedic Wilson entered the water to perform the recovery.  The firefighters were tethered together and secured to a rope line held by firefighters on shore.  Both firefighters were wearing wetsuits and buoyancy control devices called “back inflates.”

Within minutes of entering the water, Firefighter/Paramedic Wilson’s safety rope became entangled with an underwater object.  Assistant Chief Murdick also became entangled.  The rapid current made working in the water difficult.  Ropes were thrown from shore to the two firefighters, but these efforts were unsuccessful.  Firefighters on shore attempted to pull the struggling firefighters to shore, but this effort was also unsuccessful.  Approximately after 20 minutes of rescue efforts, both firefighters submerged.  When it became apparent that the firefighters could not be pulled from the water, the safety line was cut.

Approximately ten minutes after being cut free, the bodies of both firefighters appeared about 200 yards downstream.  Both firefighters were pulseless and not breathing.  ALS-level medical care was provided on-scene and enroute to the hospital by air ambulance.  Despite these efforts, both firefighters were pronounced dead at the hospital.  The cause of death for both firefighters was listed as drowning.

The firefighters were not equipped with knives that might have allowed them to free themselves.  Darkness and a faster than expected stream current were cited as contributing to the firefighters’ deaths.

Firefighter Reed had experience as an electrician and had performed electrical maintenance tasks in fire stations in the past.  The problem with the lighting fixture had been discovered by a previous shift when the tubes in the fixture had been changed.

Firefighter Reed was working with his back to a 24-foot extension ladder, which had been extended to a length of approximately 18 feet.  A firefighter was at the base of the ladder to keep it from moving as Firefighter Reed worked.  

As Firefighter Reed was working on the fixture, he leaned forward and fell to the floor of the apparatus bay, a distance of 15 feet.  Firefighter Reed impacted the floor with his head and shoulder.  After one attempt to rise from the floor, Firefighter Reed stopped breathing and his heart stopped.  ALS-level EMS care was provided immediately by other firefighters, and Firefighter Reed was transported to the hospital.  Firefighter Reed was pronounced dead upon his arrival at the hospital.

An autopsy revealed electrical burns on Firefighter Reed's right hand and a possible exit wound on the back of his arm.  The cause of death was listed as electrocution.

"Lieutenant Rupkey and other members of his department were engaged in search and rescue training utilizing full structural protective clothing, including SCBA.  A mannequin was hidden in a room being used for the training, and teams of two firefighters searched for the mannequin while advancing a hoseline.  The facepieces of both firefighters were covered with a black hood to reduce visibility.

Lieutenant Rupkey and his partner searched one room and found no victim, so they moved to the second room.  Lieutenant Rupkey remained by the door as his partner searched.  The partner discovered the victim and called to Lieutenant Rupkey for assistance.  Lieutenant Rupkey stated, “I’ve got to get out of here” a couple of times and left.

Observers saw Lieutenant Rupkey rise from the floor, lean on a wall, and attempt to remove his facepiece.  Other firefighters assisted Lieutenant Rupkey by removing his facepiece and loosening his SCBA.  Lieutenant Rupkey took a couple of breaths and collapsed against the wall.  Firefighters found that Lieutenant Rupkey was not breathing and that he had no pulse.  CPR was begun immediately and medical aid was summoned.

"Firefighter Tirado and members of his department were dispatched to a report of a fire in an occupied three-story apartment building.  The first-arriving engine company reported a working fire and Firefighter Tirado responded as the tiller driver of the first-arriving ladder company.

Firefighters on-scene received reports that children were trapped in the building.  Firefighter Tirado and another firefighter from his company proceeded to the second floor of the building to conduct a search.  A search of the second floor was conducted and all of the apartments on that floor were found to be clear.  Firefighter Tirado and the other firefighter proceeded to the third floor to continue their search.  On their way to the third floor, the team encountered heavy smoke and high heat.  Both firefighters went back to the second-story landing.  Firefighter Tirado’s partner told Firefighter Tirado to wait on the landing while he retrieved additional lighting from the apparatus.

A few minutes later, Firefighter Tirado called on the radio and said that he was trapped on the third floor.  This transmission was not heard on the fireground and a second request for help was also not heard.  He called a third time and reported that he was trapped on the third floor and needed help.  Firefighter Tirado’s exit path had been blocked by fire, and he was unable to find his way out.

A defective throttle on the pumper supplying the initial attack line created water supply and pressure problems.  Firefighters were unable to advance to the third floor to rescue Firefighter Tirado.  The fire on the third floor grew to a point where it was impossible for firefighters to control it with handlines.  An aerial master stream was used to darken down the fire and allow firefighters to access the third floor.  After a number of attempts, Firefighter Tirado was discovered in a third-story bedroom.  

The cause of death was listed as asphyxiation.  Firefighter Tirado’s carboxyhemoglobin level was found to be 65%.  The fire was caused by an unsupervised twelve-year-old girl that was attempting to light a stove.  The children that were reported trapped were actually out of the building.

"Fire companies were dispatched to a report of a fire in a hardware store.  The first- arriving engine company, which had been flagged down by civilians in the area prior to the dispatch, reported a working fire with smoke venting from a second-story window.

A bystander brought the company officer from the first-arriving engine company to the rear of the building where smoke was observed venting from around a steel basement door.  The first-arriving command officer was also shown the door and ordered an engine company to stretch a line to the rear of the building.  A ladder company was ordered to the rear to assist in opening the door; Firefighter Downing was a member of this company.  The first-due rescue company, including Firefighters Fahey and Ford, searched the first floor of the hardware store and assisted with forcible entry on the exterior.  

The incident commander directed firefighters at the rear of the building to open the rear door and attack the basement fire.  Firefighters on the first floor were directed to keep the interior basement stairwell door closed and prevent the fire from extending.  The rear basement door was reinforced, and a hydraulic rescue tool was employed to open it.  Once the first door was opened, a steel gate was found inside, further delaying fire attack.

Firefighters Downing and Ford were attempting to open basement windows on the side of the building, and Firefighter Fahey was inside of the structure on the first floor.

An explosion occurred and caused major structural damage to the hardware store.  Three firefighters were trapped under debris from a wall that collapsed on the side of the hardware store; several firefighters were trapped on the second floor; firefighters who were on the roof prior to the explosion were blown upwards with several firefighters riding debris to the street below; and firefighters on the street were knocked over by the force of the explosion.

The explosion trapped and killed Firefighters Downing and Ford under the collapsed wall; their deaths were immediate.  Firefighter Fahey was blown into the basement of the structure.  He called for help on his radio, but firefighters were unable to reach him in time.

The cause of death for Firefighters Downing and Ford was internal trauma, and the cause of death for Firefighter Fahey was listed as asphyxiation.  Firefighter Fahey’s carboxyhemoglobin level was found to be 63%.  

In addition to the three fatalities, 99 firefighters were injured at this incident.

"The Thirtymile Fire began when a picnic cooking fire was abandoned and spread to the surrounding forest.  The fire was located in the Chewuch River Canyon, about 30 miles north of Winthrop, Washington.

The Northwest Regulars #6, a 21-person Type 2 crew from the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, was dispatched to the fire in the early morning hours of July 10, 2001.  The crew arrived at the fire at approximately 9:00 a.m.  After a safety briefing, the crew went to work at 11:00 a.m.

The crews worked until approximately 3:00 p.m. when they stopped to eat, rest, and sharpen their tools.  About 4:00 p.m., they responded to a request for help from another crew in the area; two of the three squads were sent to assist.  The fire began to develop quickly, and the decision was made to leave the area.  The road to safety was cut off by fire progress.

The incident commander selected a site near the river that was rocky and had less vegetation than other areas in the canyon.  Although several firefighters congregated above the road to monitor the fire, they were not prepared for the suddenness with which it arrived.  Six firefighters, including the four that died, deployed their fire shelters above the road.

After the fire passed, it was learned that Squad Boss Craven and Firefighters Fitzpatrick, Johnson, and Weaver had been killed.  The cause of death for all four firefighters was asphyxia due to inhalation of superheated products of combustion.

The Forest Service conducted a detailed assessment of the incident.  The major findings of the report were:

·	The combination of weather and fuel conditions created extraordinary circumstances for fire growth on July 10th.

·	Potential fire behavior was consistently underestimated throughout the incident.

·	In spite of the readily available water, relatively little water was applied to the fire during the initial attack phase.  This was largely due to operational problems with pumps and hoses, as well as delays in availability of a Type III helicopter.

·	The fatalities and injuries all occurred during fire shelter deployment.  Failure to adequately anticipate the severity and timing of the burnover, and failure to utilize the best location and proper deployment techniques contributed to the fatalities and injuries.

·	Leadership, management, and command and control were all ineffective due to a variety of factors, such as the lack of communications and miscommunications, fatigue, lack of situational awareness, indecisiveness, and confusion about who was in control.

·	Two civilians were involved in the entrapment due to a failure to properly close a potentially hazardous area.

·	All 10 Standard Fire Orders were violated or disregarded at some time during the course of the incident.

·	Ten of the eighteen Watch Out Situations were present or disregarded at some time during the course of the incident.

·	Records indicated that personnel on the Thirtymile Fire had very little sleep prior to their assignments, and mental fatigue affected vigilance and decision-making.

·	District fire management personnel did not assume incident command when the size and complexity of the fire exceeded the capacity of the Northwest Regulars #6.

·	The Northwest Regulars #6 crew commander served both as incident commander and crew boss.  Command roles on the Thirtymile Fire were unclear and confusing to those in command of the incident, to the rest of the crew, and to others associated with the fire.

"The Thirtymile Fire began when a picnic cooking fire was abandoned and spread to the surrounding forest.  The fire was located in the Chewuch River Canyon, about 30 miles north of Winthrop, Washington.

The Northwest Regulars #6, a 21-person Type 2 crew from the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, was dispatched to the fire in the early morning hours of July 10, 2001.  The crew arrived at the fire at approximately 9:00 a.m.  After a safety briefing, the crew went to work at 11:00 a.m.

The crews worked until approximately 3:00 p.m. when they stopped to eat, rest, and sharpen their tools.  About 4:00 p.m., they responded to a request for help from another crew in the area; two of the three squads were sent to assist.  The fire began to develop quickly, and the decision was made to leave the area.  The road to safety was cut off by fire progress.

The incident commander selected a site near the river that was rocky and had less vegetation than other areas in the canyon.  Although several firefighters congregated above the road to monitor the fire, they were not prepared for the suddenness with which it arrived.  Six firefighters, including the four that died, deployed their fire shelters above the road.

After the fire passed, it was learned that Squad Boss Craven and Firefighters Fitzpatrick, Johnson, and Weaver had been killed.  The cause of death for all four firefighters was asphyxia due to inhalation of superheated products of combustion.

The Forest Service conducted a detailed assessment of the incident.  The major findings of the report were:

·	The combination of weather and fuel conditions created extraordinary circumstances for fire growth on July 10th.

·	Potential fire behavior was consistently underestimated throughout the incident.

·	In spite of the readily available water, relatively little water was applied to the fire during the initial attack phase.  This was largely due to operational problems with pumps and hoses, as well as delays in availability of a Type III helicopter.

·	The fatalities and injuries all occurred during fire shelter deployment.  Failure to adequately anticipate the severity and timing of the burnover, and failure to utilize the best location and proper deployment techniques contributed to the fatalities and injuries.

·	Leadership, management, and command and control were all ineffective due to a variety of factors, such as the lack of communications and miscommunications, fatigue, lack of situational awareness, indecisiveness, and confusion about who was in control.

·	Two civilians were involved in the entrapment due to a failure to properly close a potentially hazardous area.

·	All 10 Standard Fire Orders were violated or disregarded at some time during the course of the incident.

·	Ten of the eighteen Watch Out Situations were present or disregarded at some time during the course of the incident.

·	Records indicated that personnel on the Thirtymile Fire had very little sleep prior to their assignments, and mental fatigue affected vigilance and decision-making.

·	District fire management personnel did not assume incident command when the size and complexity of the fire exceeded the capacity of the Northwest Regulars #6.

·	The Northwest Regulars #6 crew commander served both as incident commander and crew boss.  Command roles on the Thirtymile Fire were unclear and confusing to those in command of the incident, to the rest of the crew, and to others associated with the fire.

"Pilot Gilbert was operating a single-engine air tanker while fighting a 500-acre fire.  The Cottonwood Creek Fire was located in the Idaho backcountry south of the Salmon River.

Pilot Gilbert was preparing to make his second retardant drop of the day and was in radio contact with firefighters on the ground and with other aircraft.  For reasons unknown, the aircraft crashed.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident.

"Firefighter-EMT Verburg and three other firefighters were conducting standard fire hydrant maintenance duties.  The first team of two firefighters removed the caps and opened each hydrant.  Firefighter-EMT Verburg and another firefighter closed each hydrant when the water ran clear and then lubricated and reinstalled the caps.

After completing maintenance on a hydrant, Firefighter-EMT Verburg took her seat on the passenger side of their ambulance and the other firefighter drove.  As they proceeded out of a dead end street, a large portion of a dead tree fell onto the cab of the ambulance.  Firefighter-EMT Verburg was killed and her partner was injured.

Removal of the tree to gain access to Firefighter-EMT Verburg was very difficult (the tree was later weighed and found to be in excess of 3,700 pounds).  Firefighters were eventually able to access Firefighter-EMT Verburg's neck and hands and found no pulse.  It is believed that she died instantly.

The cause of death was listed as compressional asphyxia.",Cynthia,Verburg,J.,47,Firefighter-EMT,Career,10-Jul-01,10-Jul-01,Struck By,Trauma,Support,No,Other On-Duty,Street/Road,
"Firefighter Chavis and members of his department were dispatched to a report of a residential structure fire.  When firefighters arrived on-scene, the patio style home was well involved and fire was extending to a second home.

Firefighter Chavis relieved another firefighter who had run low on air.  He entered an open garage with a charged hoseline and began to apply water to the fire.  The garage was situated below the living area above.  Five minutes after taking over the handline, Firefighter Chavis was knocked to the ground by a partial collapse of the floor/ceiling assembly above the garage.  Firefighter Chavis began to crawl toward the garage door opening with burning debris on top of him.  As he neared safety, the remainder of the garage floor/ceiling assembly and the garage door fell on top of him.  

Firefighter Chavis’ SCBA high-pressure line burned through and he was exposed to direct flame contact for over a minute.  Other firefighters and civilians on-scene came to Firefighter Chavis’ aid.  He was transported to the hospital by a medical helicopter.  He suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 50% of his body.

Firefighter Chavis died of complications of his burns on July 12, 2001.

The Lexington County Fire Service was fined $3,250 by the South Carolina State Occupational Safety and Health Administration for work safety violations that occurred at the fire where Firefighter Chavis was injured.  The major violations included lack of supervision by a commander and lack of communications between the interior and exterior of the hazard zone.  A lack of staffing was also cited, 30 minutes into the incident only 5 firefighters were on the scene.

"Lieutenant Mathis was responding to a car/pedestrian incident from his place of work in a nearby community.  As Lieutenant Mathis rounded a left-hand curve, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the center line and impacted the motorcycle operated by Lieutenant Mathis.

The motorcycle left the roadway, and Lieutenant Mathis was thrown over 16 feet past the final resting place of the motorcycle.  The crash was reported and local emergency personnel responded.  When EMS and fire department personnel arrived, Lieutenant Mathis was alert and oriented.  His left leg had been amputated below the knee.  His condition was serious, so he was transported to the hospital by medical helicopter.

During transport to the hospital, Lieutenant Mathis’ condition worsened.  Vital signs were lost during the flight, and he was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at the hospital.

Lieutenant Mathis was wearing a helmet at the time of the collision.  The cause of death was listed as multiple blunt trauma.

Rain water made the slide more slippery than expected.  Captain White traveled so quickly that he bounced and became airborne.  Captain White sustained a severe head injury.

EMS personnel on the scene attended to him, and he was transported to a local hospital in critical condition.  Captain White was on life support in the hospital but died on July 19, 2001.

"Engineer Schafer was becoming acquainted with a new engine apparatus that had recently been delivered to his department.  The engine was not yet in service.  Another firefighter had brought his child to the fire station and had requested and received permission to allow the child to operate a small hoseline off of the new unit.

The apparatus was parked near a 500-gallon water storage tank.  A 2""-inch hoseline was connected to a discharge on the water tank and to a discharge on the new engine to fill the engine's booster tank.  Connecting a fill line to the discharge side of a pump was an unwritten practice for members assigned to this fire station.

The high-pressure booster pump was engaged to charge the hoseline.  The pump-to-tank valve (tank fill) was closed.  The booster pump produced pressure that fed back through the fill line and overpressurized the water storage tank.

The tank failed near its bottom causing it to become airborne.  Witness accounts estimated that the tank rose as high as 100 feet in the air.  At the same moment, Engineer Schafer was either climbing into or out of the cab of the apparatus. The tank landed on the roof of the engine and struck Engineer Schafer.

Engineer Schafer received a severe head injury.  Other firefighters came immediately to his aid, and ALS-level EMS care was provided.  Despite these efforts, Engineer Schafer died the next day.

A check valve present on the water tank discharge or associated with the booster pump would have prevented this incident.

"At approximately 1:00 a.m., Firefighter Rendek and other wildland firefighters were organized as a crew and sent to size up a wildland fire near Sula, Montana.  When they arrived, they found that it was too dangerous to fight the fire in the dark due to steep terrain and a large amount of dead wood.  The decision was made to wait until morning to fight the fire.  The crew spent the night laying hose and cold trailing hot spots outside of the main fire area.

The next morning, Firefighter Rendek was cutting down dangerous trees (falling snags) with a chain saw.  A helicopter equipped with a bucket was working the fire but was not in the same area where Firefighter Rendek was working.

Handcrews were about to begin work.  Firefighter Rendek said that he only needed a few more minutes to work and then he was going to rest.  As he walked downhill to his work area, a pine tree with a diameter of 11 inches fell and struck Firefighter Rendek on the head and shoulders.

When other firefighters reached Firefighter Rendek, he was not breathing and a pulse could not be found.  CPR was initiated and then stopped when Firefighter Rendek began to breathe on his own.  Firefighter Rendek’s condition deteriorated and CPR was reinitiated.

"Chief Bennett was responding to a medical emergency in his fire department command vehicle, a 2001 Dodge pickup.  Chief Bennett’s vehicle and an ambulance were responding together.  When the ambulance lost sight of Chief Bennett’s vehicle, they began to search for it.

Chief Bennett had entered a left-hand curve and drove off of the right side of the road.  He attempted to bring the vehicle back on the road but the rear end came around and the vehicle began to roll.  The pickup rolled several times and came to rest on its wheels in a field.  Chief Bennett was ejected at some point and sustained severe head injuries.  He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

The police report cited excessive speed and slippery pavement as factors in the collision.  Severe thunderstorms were in the area at the time of the crash.

"Lieutenant Augustyn and his engine company responded to a vehicle crash on a bridge.  Upon their arrival, fire department ambulance staff released the engine from the call.  Lieutenant Augustyn had one firefighter move a law enforcement vehicle so that the engine could back down from the bridge.  Lieutenant Augustyn was on the driver’s side of the engine and motioned the driver to back up.  He also used his portable radio to speak with the driver.  The driver began to slowly back up the apparatus.

Lieutenant Augustyn either stumbled or was hit by the back step of the engine.  He ended up perpendicular to the apparatus and was crushed underneath.

Bystanders and other firefighters yelled and honked their horns to get the driver’s attention.  The apparatus was stopped.  Firefighters from Lieutenant Augustyn’s company and from the ambulance began treatment immediately.  The apparatus was raised with airbags from a responding truck company and Lieutenant Augustyn was transported to the hospital.

Lieutenant Augustyn died the next day.  The cause of death was multiple trauma.

"Firefighter Marriott was assigned as the engine operator for an engine company that responded to a report of a boat fire on a dock.  The area was very crowded due to a boating festival that was underway.

Firefighter Marriott was assigned to attach a supply line to a hydrant and then to extend a 2½-inch line wyed off into two 1¾-inch lines as soon as additional firefighters arrived to assist him.  Firefighter Marriott was walking past the pump panel on his engine when he was struck with a heart attack.  Other firefighter/EMTs and firefighter/paramedics were very close by and immediately began treatment.  Firefighter Marriott received ALS-level care and was transported to a nearby hospital.  He was later pronounced dead by an emergency room physician.

The report of a boat fire turned out to be a barbeque aboard a boat.

An engine company was responding on the same incident and was nearly struck by the water tank as it rolled downhill.  After witnessing the crash, the engine firefighters went to the aid of the trapped firefighters.  Both firefighters were talking when they reached the truck but Firefighter White stopped breathing shortly thereafter.  Both firefighters were extricated from the crushed cab.  The driver was transported to the hospital by medical helicopter.

The police report cited excessive speed and failure to maintain control as contributing factors in the crash.  An inspection of the remains of the tanker found that the rear brakes were out of adjustment.

Firefighter White died of internal trauma.

"Chief Varble responded to the report of a vehicle collision on a local highway.  Since the scene of the collision was only about a mile from her house, she was the first fire department member on-scene.  Chief Varble discovered that a vehicle that was being towed had separated from the tow vehicle and crashed.

Firefighter Olander and his ladder company were dispatched to the scene.  They proceeded to the rear of the structure and were ordered to effect the rescue of victims trapped by the fire and awaiting rescue at windows on the fourth floor.  Due to limited staffing, firefighters were unable to raise a 50-foot ground ladder, and electrical wires in the alley prevented the use of the aerial ladder.

An engine company arrived on the scene, a water supply was established, and 2 attack lines were advanced.  Firefighter Murray, who was a city employee, arrived in his city vehicle at this time.  The fire chief and Firefighter Murray joined 2 other firefighters in the interior and completed a primary search of the structure.  Finding an all-clear, the fire chief and Firefighter Murray retrieved a hoseline from the front entrance of the house for fire control.

The hoselines were not having much effect on the fire and the second hose line became useless when the booster tank on the second engine ran out of water.  A third line was deployed but interior conditions continued to worsen.  Based on his view of the exterior of the structure, the Incident Commander (IC )ordered an evacuation.  Due to problems with the IC’s radio, firefighters inside the structure did not hear the order.

Conditions continued to worsen inside the structure, and the fire chief ordered everyone to exit the structure.  A firefighter and a lieutenant were first out the door and made it to the front yard.  The chief, however, had difficulty exiting and collapsed just after stepping outside the structure.  He could not get up and was helped to safety by other firefighters.  An accountability report was taken, and Firefighter Murray was found to be missing.

The fire had progressed to the point that further entry into the structure was impossible.  A deck gun was used to darken down the fire.  Firefighters were able to see Firefighter Murray about 5 feet inside of the front door of the structure.  He was removed to the street where EMS treatment was initiated.  CPR was started and continued as Firefighter Murray was transported to the hospital.  He was pronounced dead upon arrival.

"Chief Jones and members of his department were dispatched to a report of a structure fire.  The first engine arrived on the scene and reported a fully involved structure.  The IC learned that there was a burn victim in the house across the street from the burning structure, and a medic unit was directed to the house to initiate treatment.  About the same time, Chief Jones arrived at the command post and asked how he could help.  The IC asked Chief Jones to interview the burn victim prior to transport to the hospital.

Moments after Chief Jones left the command post, gunfire was heard on the fire scene.  Firefighters were ordered by the IC to take cover and a personnel accountability report was ordered.  All firefighters were accounted for except Chief Jones.

When Chief Jones had approached the house to talk with the burn victim, the man opened fire and struck Chief Jones and a paramedic employed by a private company that responded on the initial dispatch.  Police officers were able to move Chief Jones and the paramedic to a shielded area.  On-scene efforts were diverted from the fire fight and treatment was provided to the injured.

Chief Jones suffered a severe gunshot wound to the head.  He was treated on-scene by his firefighters and local EMS workers.  He was transported to the hospital and ended up at a regional hospital in Texas.  He survived until March 26, 2002, when he died of complications of his injury.

The shooter, a man with a history of mental illness, had set the structure fire.  He shot and killed Chief Jones, the paramedic, and a neighbor.  He shot and injured the neighbor’s 3-year-old boy, and took another 5-year-old child hostage prior to ending his own life.  Chief Jones’ wife is a firefighter with the Fort Worth Fire Department in Texas.

"Firefighter Martin and Firefighter Morrison responded as a part of a rescue company crew to the report of a fire in a 2-story commercial building.

First-arriving firefighters found light smoke showing and a fire on the first floor.  While other firefighters opened up the building, engine company firefighters advanced a hoseline into the first floor area and knocked down the fire.  As the ceiling on the first floor was pulled, fire was noted in the space between the first and second floors.  Fire extension into the second floor was suspected.  The handline was removed from the first floor and advanced to the second floor.

An engine company captain became separated from his crew at the rear of the first floor of the building.  He opened a roll-up door for egress.  The fresh air supplied by the open door allowed the remaining fire on the first floor to progress rapidly.  A metal security gate at the base of the roll-up door prevented his escape.  The captain was able to escape when firefighters and civilians at the rear of the structure moved the gate to permit his exit.

He was engaged in an evolution that required him to descend to approximately 60 feet and retrieve a concrete block.  The purpose of the exercise was to give the students experience with using tools to retrieve a heavy item in zero visibility and bring that item to the surface.  The students used a rope tied to a 3-pound weight on the bottom as an ascent/descent line.

Visibility at the bottom was very poor.  At some point, Private Jolliff and his partner were attaching ropes to the block as they had been instructed.

"Members of Firefighter Cusson’s fire department were on the scene of a mutual aid fire in a lumber yard.  Firefighter Cusson arrived on the scene and told the fire chief that he had not been wearing his pager and that he missed the dispatch.  The fire chief directed him to return to the fire station to retrieve his protective clothing and then return to the scene.

Firefighter Cusson was driving his personal vehicle, a 1996 Ford Ranger pickup.

As he drove to the fire station, Firefighter Cusson passed a vehicle that had yielded for his blue light.  He then entered a left-hand curve, and his vehicle left the roadway and went onto the right shoulder.  Firefighter Cusson steered the vehicle back off the shoulder but was unable to maintain control.  Firefighter Cusson’s vehicle left the right side of the road and impacted a utility pole and a large-diameter tree.  Firefighter Cusson, who was not wearing a seat belt, was partially ejected from his vehicle.

The fire chief was notified of the crash and instructed the dispatch center to send a mutual aid fire department to the scene.  The fire chief also responded and found Firefighter Cusson dead at the scene.

The police incident report related to this crash estimated Firefighter Cusson’s speed to be in excess of 77 miles per hour in a 40 mile per hour zone.  The cause of death was listed as blunt trauma of the chest.

"Captain Granholm and members of his department responded to the scene of a car fire on a local interstate highway.  The driver of the vehicle reported that the fire was out but firefighters continued to the scene to make sure.  A pumper arrived on the scene and parked downstream from the involved vehicle on the right shoulder.  A police cruiser parked upstream of the incident on the right shoulder with its emergency warning lights in operation.

An approaching sedan slowed as it came upon the scene.  The sedan was rear-ended by a pickup truck that was towing a trailer.  The collision propelled the sedan into a spin and the vehicle veered to the right.  The sedan struck the police car, spun into the group of firefighters and others on the scene, and pushed the vehicle that originated the incident into the pumper.

Captain Granholm was struck by one of the involved vehicles.  Two other firefighters, a police officer, and a civilian were also struck.   Captain Granholm was airlifted to a regional hospital where he died in surgery.  The cause of death was listed as multiple injuries with laceration of the aorta and exsanguination (blood loss).

"Firefighter Wyatt was a seasonal tree faller hired by the Forest Service.  He first worked the Million fire and was then directed to report to the Missionary Ridge fire on July 1, 2002.  He reported for work the morning of July 2, 2002, and was assigned to assist clearing dangerous trees near a road in an area that had already burned.

After a pause in work because of dangerous winds, fallers were briefed on potential hazards and on the work plan for the afternoon.  Firefighter Wyatt began to cut down a tree that had been marked for removal.  Out of his line of sight, a fire damaged tree fell in his direction.  The tree fell from behind Firefighter Wyatt.

A skid operator who saw the incident from a distance ran to the aid of Firefighter Wyatt.  The tree that trapped him was cut into pieces and he was freed.  Firefighter Wyatt suffered severe head injuries and a broken leg.  He was moved to a safe area by other firefighters where it was determined that Firefighter Wyatt had died.  The cause of death was listed as head trauma.

The tree that fell and crushed Firefighter Wyatt was a large aspen.  The roots of the tree had been weakened by fire, allowing the tree to fall.  Firefighter Wyatt was not working with a swamper (assistant) at the time of the incident.  One of the duties of a swamper is to keep watch for hazards that may be out of the faller’s view.

"Recruit Firefighter Waybright was in the third day of a 20-week recruit training course.  The temperature was 84 degrees and the heat index was 96 degrees.

The day began at 0700 with physical training which included a ½-mile walk, a 3.7-mile run, 15 to 20 minutes of calisthenics, and 2 sets of uphill wind sprints, each covering about 300 feet.  No water was provided to the recruits during the physical training.  The effects of the exertion on the recruits was not recognized by the instructors who led the recruits during the physical training.

During a jog returning to the training facility, Recruit Firefighter Waybright complained of feeling dizzy and collapsed.  He was found to be in cardiac arrest; his skin was cold and clammy.  CPR was initiated and paramedics responded to the scene.  When Recruit Firefighter Waybright arrived at the hospital, his core temperature was 107.6 degrees.  He was pronounced dead at 0921.  The cause of death was listed as hyperthermia.

In August of 2000, the recruit academy was criticized for cruel treatment of recruits, including forcing recruits to do push-ups for sips of water.  During their investigation of the July, 2002, incident, Maryland Occupation, Safety, and Health (MOSH) cited Frederick County with 2 “serious” safety violations.  The recruit training program was closed in January of 2003.

Recruit Firefighter Waybright was also an EMS Captain with the Harney Volunteer Fire Department in Maryland.

"The Gloucester City Fire Department was dispatched to a structure fire in a residential building.  While units were responding, dispatch advised units of a working fire with people trapped.  When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found a well-involved fire in a 3-story wood-frame structure with fire threatening a connected exposure building of the same size.  Heavy smoke was showing from the exposure.  Mount Ephraim Fire Department’s rescue company was also dispatched upon the report of a working fire.

The amount of fire in the building of origin prohibited an interior attack.  The initial arriving officer saw movement in a window on the second floor of the exposure.  Firefighters were directed to stretch an attack line into the exposure for search and rescue and fire control.  Firefighters found that fire had extended into the second  floor of the exposure and conducted suppression efforts but were unable to locate any occupants.

Facing heavy fire in the original structure and extension into the exposure, master streams were applied into the original structure.  The bulk of the fire was knocked down in the original fire building while crews continued to operate in the exposure.  An occupant (mother) was found in the rear portion of the first floor of the exposure by interior crews and was removed from the structure.  An interior crew reported a missing firefighter and the structure was evacuated to conduct an accountability of operating personnel.  The firefighter was almost immediately accounted for yet there were still 3 building occupants (children) that had not been located.  A crew of 8 firefighters and chief officers, including Firefighter Stewart, Chief Sylvester, and Deputy Fire Marshal West, entered the front of the exposure structure to conduct a search.  At the 30-minute mark since the dispatch of the incident, the interior crews reported that they were leaving the structure due to conditions.  Within seconds of these reports, both the original fire-involved structure and the exposure structure experienced a catastrophic collapse.  The collapse occurred approximately 34 minutes after the initial alarm of fire.  

Two firefighters freed themselves after the collapse.  Four firefighters were trapped in the collapse.  Rescue efforts began immediately and 2 of the firefighters were freed, with the first taking approximately 25 minutes and the last removed almost 1-1/2 hours after the collapse.  After an extensive recovery and rescue effort, the bodies of Firefighter Stewart, Chief Sylvester, and Deputy Fire Marshal West were found and removed from the rubble.  Three children, who resided in the original fire structure, were also killed in the incident.

The cause of death for all 3 firefighters was fixed compression as the result of being crushed by the collapse.

Deputy Fire Marshal West was also a deputy chief with the Mount Ephraim Fire Department.

Prior to the start of the exercises, all firefighters on the scene participated in a walk-through of the structure.  The object of the exercise was for 2 firefighters to enter the structure in full structural protective clothing and SCBA and search for a rescue mannequin dressed in protective clothing.  Once the mannequin was located, the firefighters were to remove the mannequin from the structure.  Two other teams were assigned to enter the structure and control the fire.  Four instructors were placed inside the structure to monitor safety.  A Rapid Intervention Team (RIT) crew consisting of 2 firefighters stood by outside the structure.

During the first evolution of the day, the mannequin was placed in the kitchen in the western portion of the structure.  A bedroom in the northeast portion of the structure was used as the point of origin for the fire.  The bedroom was just inside of the front door of the structure on the right side of the hallway.  

Fuel for the fire consisted of pallets and straw placed in and outside of a closet in the bedroom.  The fuel was ignited with a road flare.  Some time prior to the beginning of the training evolution, a foam mattress was placed on top of the burning pallets and straw.

Lieutenant Mickel and Firefighter Begg entered the structure as the search and rescue team at 1011.  They entered the bedroom to perform a search as the first attack team entered the structure behind them.  The second attack team stood by at the front door.  When firefighters entered the structure, they found  zero visibility with heavy heat and smoke.

The safety officer monitoring the interior lost track of the search and rescue team, thinking that they had exited the fire room and passed him.  The safety officer began to search the rest of the structure in an attempt to locate Lieutenant Mickel and Firefighter Begg.  At that time, the attack team began to apply water in short bursts to the fire room as the windows of the room were broken out by a firefighter on the exterior.  A great deal of steam was produced as the water was applied.  When the window was broken out, the fire room flashed over.  The firefighter who had ventilated the window reached inside and found the heat damaged shell of a firefighter’s helmet.

The helmet discovery was reported to the IC.  The IC asked repeatedly for an accountability report from the search and rescue team with no answer.  The second attack team entered the structure and extinguished the fire in the area of origin.  After the fire was controlled, the firefighters from the second attack team began to overhaul the room.  They found a form on the floor in firefighter’s protective clothing and assumed that the form was the training mannequin.

The IC did not receive any response to his calls to the search and rescue team, so he ordered a personnel accountability report and ordered the RIT team to enter the structure and find the search and rescue team.  The time was 1120.  Positive personnel accountability reports were received from all teams except the search and rescue team.  The IC ordered an evacuation of the structure.  As the second attack team began to leave the structure, they reached down to drag out the form that they thought was a mannequin and found that the form was Lieutenant Mickel.  As Lieutenant Mickel was removed through the window, the body of Firefighter Begg was found.  The report of firefighters down was transmitted at 1024.

Both firefighters were provided with ALS-level EMS services and transported to the hospital where they were pronounced dead.  The cause of death for both firefighters was listed as burns and smoke inhalation.

The carbon monoxide level for Lieutenant Mickel was found to be 23 percent and the level for Firefighter Begg was found to be 22.5 percent.

Firefighter Begg had been employed by Osceola County Fire-Rescue for 8 days.  Lieutenant Mickel was a 9-year veteran of the department.

"Coos Bay Fire & Rescue was dispatched to the report of a fire in a building that contained a truck and auto supply store and a machine shop.  The fire was first discovered by building occupants who smelled smoke and discovered warm walls and fire behind the wall in an upstairs bathroom.  The occupants attempted to fight the fire prior to calling the fire department.  When firefighters arrived on the scene, they reported a light smoke condition.

Firefighters advanced 2 attack lines into the building.  Lieutenant Carpenter, Firefighter Common, and Firefighter Hanners were working on the second floor of the building.  Finding no visible fire, the firefighters opened up the walls and ceiling to expose and extinguish the fire.  When the fire hidden in these concealed spaces was exposed to fresh air, it progressed rapidly.

Firefighters on the roof reported that the roof was feeling spongy, and the IC ordered an evacuation of the building.  At approximately the same time, the roof and other structural supports over the second floor collapsed.  Fire spread rapidly throughout the building.

Lieutenant Carpenter and Firefighter Common were trapped under the debris on the second floor.  Firefighter Hanners, who may have been descending the stairs at the time of the collapse, was propelled down the stairs by the force of the collapse and ended up behind a customer service counter.

A personnel accountability report found that 3 firefighters were missing.  Other firefighters advanced attack lines into the building to search for the trapped firefighters.  Firefighter Hanners was discovered and removed from the building.  Due to fire conditions and structural instability, firefighters were unable to reach Lieutenant Carpenter and Firefighter Common until the fire was controlled.

All 3 firefighters died of asphyxiation and exposure to heat and smoke.  Lieutenant Carpenter had a carboxyhemoglobin level of 53 percent and Firefighter Common’s level was 49 percent.  Firefighter Hanners’ carboxyhemoglobin level at autopsy was 3 percent.  The medical examiner noted that Firefighter Hanners had undergone extensive life-saving measures including the administration of oxygen, and that the level of carbon monoxide in his blood was likely much higher prior to his removal from the building.

The fire was caused when heat from the flue of a propane-fueled  incinerator/parts cleaner ignited structural components in the wall and ceiling of the building’s second floor.  The fire may have burned in these concealed spaces for as long as 4 hours prior to discovery.  The cleaner had been installed without a permit, and it was improperly installed.  The owner of the business and the installer were later charged with criminally negligent homicide.

"Firefighter Collins was responding in his personal vehicle to a report of a motor vehicle crash.  As he neared the fire station, he came to an intersection and met a responding engine approaching from the opposite direction.  Firefighter Collins' vehicle and the engine stopped at their respective stops signs.  Firefighter Collins was preparing to proceed across the intersection enroute to the fire station and the engine was preparing to make a turn.

As Firefighter Collins proceeded through the intersection, his vehicle was struck on the right side by a vehicle traveling on the intersecting highway.  The force of the collision drove Firefighter Collins' vehicle through the intersection, almost striking the responding engine.  Firefighter Collins had apparently not seen the vehicle that struck him due to a blind spot or as a result of being focused on the presence of the engine.

Firefighters immediately went to the aid of Firefighter Collins and found him laying across the front seat of his car with his head against the passenger's door.  Firefighters could not find any vital signs but attempted to maintain an airway as extrication was accomplished.

"Firefighter Staley and members of his department and mutual aid departments were dispatched to a fire in a commercial occupancy.  The fire involved a specialized vehicle restoration shop.

The first-arriving command officer reported a working fire and requested additional resources.  Firefighter Staley arrived on the first engine company.  Firefighter Staley and other firefighters stretched a 1-3/4 inch handline with Compressed Air Foam (CAF).  Upon entry to the shop, they found light smoke from the ceiling to the floor.  A portable positive pressure fan was placed in a doorway.

The fire began to intensify and began to roll over the top of the attack crew.  One attack crewmember was forced to leave because his hands were burning.  As this firefighter reached to exterior, air horns began to sound indicating that firefighters should evacuate the building.  Two of the attack line crewmembers exited the building – both suffered burns.  Firefighter Staley did not exit.

Approximately 30 seconds after the third firefighter left the building, an explosion occurred inside of the building.

Firefighters quickly determined that Firefighter Staley was missing.  A Rapid Intervention Crew (RIC) was deployed to the interior but they were forced to exit the building when evacuation horns were sounded again.  Ladder pipes were used to knock down the fire and the RIC was allowed to reenter the structure.  The RIC was forced to leave again due to fire progress and an unreliable water supply.  After master streams were used to knock down the fire again, firefighters located Firefighter Staley inside of the structure.

Firefighter Staley likely became disoriented inside of the structure and ran out of air.  He received injuries from the explosion, both of his eardrums were ruptured and there was damage to his lungs consistent with the explosion.  He was found in the prone position with the regulator removed from his SCBA facepiece.  His PASS device was sounding but was muffled by the position of his body. 

The cause of death was listed as thermal injuries with smoke inhalation and blast injuries.

The fire began when a flooring contractor used a flammable liquid to prepare a floor.  Vapors were ignited when a portable heater was used to speed the drying process.

"Lieutenant Kirk and Private Zachary were assigned to Engine Company 31.  Lieutenant Kirk was working an overtime shift.

At 1946hrs, E31 and other Memphis Fire Department companies were dispatched to the scene of a structure fire involving a Family Dollar Store.  As they arrived on-scene, they found smoke showing from the store at the end of a strip mall.

Lieutenant Kirk and a Lieutenant from another fire company proceeded through the retail area of the store and encountered only light smoke.  When they attempted to enter a small office in the stock area at the rear of the store, they encountered a working fire.  They were unable to close the office door and the fire advanced rapidly.

Private Zachary and other firefighters advanced handlines into the interior of the store and began fire suppression operations.  As they worked in the rear of the structure, conditions worsened rapidly as dense smoke and high heat levels filled the building.  Private Zachary requested relief and left the nozzle to return to the exterior.  He likely became disoriented in the smoke although his actions after leaving the nozzle are unknown.

Lieutenant Kirk and another firefighter began to direct their hose stream into the stockroom area.  They heard a firefighter call for help.  A structural collapse occurred and knocked Lieutenant Kirk and the other firefighter to their knees.  Lieutenant Kirk transmitted a Mayday call and said that he was trapped in the building.  The collapse occurred approximately 17 minutes after the initial dispatch.

The firefighter with Lieutenant Kirk was able to free him from the debris and both firefighters headed for the front of the store following their hoseline.  As the firefighter crawled over a large pile of debris, he and Lieutenant Kirk lost contact.  

Previous to the collapse, a rescue company had been assigned Rapid Intervention Crew (RIC) duties.  Upon hearing Lieutenant Kirk’s Mayday, the RIC advanced into the interior of the store and began their search.  The RIC located and removed a firefighter; he was out of air and disoriented.  The RIC then located the firefighter that had been with Lieutenant Kirk; he too was out of air and disoriented.

A ladder company was the only fire company at the rear of the building.  They had forced entry to a rear door but did not have a handline and could not advance into the building.  These firefighters heard an activated PASS device in the interior after hearing reports of missing firefighters.  The rear sector commander allowed firefighters to enter the interior without a handline to search for the downed firefighters.  Upon entering the structure, firefighters heard 2 PASS devices.  They were able to follow the sound to Private Zachary and remove him from the building.  Upon his removal, ALS-level EMS procedures were initiated and he was transported to the hospital.

Firefighters made repeated rescue efforts but were driven from the store by rapid fire progress and their efforts were slowed by the structural collapse.  Due to fire conditions, the IC ordered an end to all interior operations.

After the major body of fire was controlled with exterior streams, a rescue company breached a wall at the rear of the structure.  The location of the hole was based on reports of the whereabouts of Lieutenant Kirk.  He was removed from the building and transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.   Lieutenant Kirk received burns over 97-percent of his body, his carboxyhemoglobin level was 29-percent.  The cause of death was listed as burns.

Private Zachary suffered severe surface and inhalation burns.  Private Zachary died as the result of his thermal inhalation injuries on June 16, 2003.

The cause of the fire was determined to be arson.  The store manager ignited the fire in an office to the rear of the structure.

"Firefighter Utley and members of his fire department were working numerous emergency calls associated with storms that were passing through the area.  Firefighter Utley left the scene of a motor vehicle collision to respond to a mutual aid request for assistance in a flooded area with trapped civilians.

Firefighter Utley was responding along a 2-lane road with his emergency equipment in operation.  He was driving his personal pickup truck.

Firefighter Utley’s pickup hydroplaned on the wet road surface, crossed over the opposing lane of the road, struck a ditch which turned the truck sideways, and collided with the support post of a billboard.  The door on the driver’s side of the pickup sustained the major impact of the crash.

A motorist that came upon the crash site called 911 and firefighters from the Grayson Fire Department responded to the scene.  Firefighter Utley was extricated and transported to a trauma center.  He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Firefighter Utley was not wearing a seat belt.  Due to the lack of skid marks, his speed could not be estimated.  The cause of death was listed as massive head and chest trauma.

"Lead Forestry Technician Lupe was assisting with a prescribed burn involving approximately 2,000 acres on land that is part of an Apache Tribe reservation near White River.  Lead Forestry Technician Lupe joined the effort during the third day of the burn.

An assigned lookout reported an increase in fire activity on the Southeast portion of the burn.  Lead Forestry Technician Lupe advised that he would conduct reconnaissance of the area.  A short time later, the area being investigated by Lead Forestry Technician Lupe experienced extreme fire behavior, evidenced by a large column of smoke.

Lupe transmitted calls to other firefighters advising them to back out of the area and to take refuge in safe areas that had already burned.  The fire advanced quickly and overcame Lead Forestry Technician Lupe.  He was unable to deploy his fire shelter due to the fact that embers on the ground would have burned him.

Nearby crews received radio calls from Lead Forestry Technician Lupe requesting medical assistance.  He reported that he had been burned.  Lupe was able to walk out of the area and meet firefighters.

Lead Forestry Technician Lupe was transported by firefighters to a helicopter landing area.  He was flown to a local hospital and then flown again to a regional burn center.  Lead Forestry Technician Lupe died on June 19, 2003, as a result of complications of his burns.

"Assistant Chief Dawdy was the driver of a military surplus 2-1/2 ton 6 by 6 vehicle that had been converted to a fire department tanker.  The water tank capacity was 1,200 gallons.  

State-wide mutual aid assistance had been requested for a wildland fire in a national forest.  Assistant Chief Dawdy drove the tanker; he was followed by another firefighter in a fire department SUV.  The pair planned to spend a week on the fire shuttling water to brush trucks on the fire line.

After traveling approximately 135 miles, Assistant Chief Dawdy was operating the tanker on a rough road within the forest.  The road curved and sloped downhill.  Assistant Chief Dawdy lost control of the tanker, it rolled over in the roadway, left the roadway and rolled over 3 more times before coming to rest on its wheels approximately 123 feet from the roadway in a canyon.  Assistant Chief Dawdy was ejected during one of the early rolls and was crushed as the tanker rolled over him.

The other firefighter following in the SUV came upon the crash and searched for Assistant Chief Dawdy.  When he located him, the firefighter determined that Assistant Chief Dawdy was dead.

Inspections of the tanker after the crash revealed that the brakes were 100-percent ineffective due to leaks at the master cylinder and slave cylinder.  The brake fluid reservoir was empty at the time of the crash and a number of brake fluid containers were found aboard the tanker.  In addition, the tanker was not equipped with seatbelts.

"The 8 firefighters were a part of a 20-member contract fire fighting crew.  The firefighters were returning from 11 days of fighting fires Idaho’s Boise National Forest.  The firefighters rode in a 16-passenger van as a part of a caravan of 2 vans and a truck.

As the van traveled through a 2-lane sloped curve marked as a no passing area, it crossed the centerline to pass a tractor-trailer truck.  The van struck a tractor-trailer truck traveling in the opposite direction head-on.  When the vehicles came to rest, a fire began which consumed the van and the majority of the tractor-trailer.  The occupants of the tractor-trailer truck were able to escape the fire but all 8 firefighters remained in the burning wreckage of the van. 

The crew boss was in the lead vehicle some distance ahead and did not witness the crash.  When the crew boss lost radio contact with the firefighters, they pulled over to wait for them to catch up.  Seeing smoke in the distance, they drove to the crash scene and found the van totally engulfed in fire.

As they traveled home, members of the crew had purchased beer and other food items in Idaho and again at a store just previous to the crash.  Although tests were unable to exactly determine the amount of alcohol in the driver’s blood, it is accepted that the driver of the van had been consuming alcohol before the crash.

All 8 firefighters were either killed in the crash of the ensuing fire and were pronounced dead at the scene

"Firefighters in New Knoxville responded to a report of a fire in an 80-foot tall concrete silo.  The silo was 20 feet in diameter and contained sawdust and wood scrap from a manufacturing business.  The sawdust and wood scrap were accumulated in the silo and then conveyed by mechanical equipment for use as fuel for an on-site electrical generation and heating plant.  The manufacturing occupancy had been the site of numerous previous fires in all areas of the operation.

Firefighters observed smoke coming from a room at the base of the silo and from the top of the silo.  They observed burning wood materials falling out of the bottom of the silo.  They also used a thermal imaging camera and observed hot spots close to the base of the silo and about 15 feet above the base of the silo.  Roof access was limited to a small ladder that scaled the side of the silo.  The decision was made to request mutual aid from the New Bremen/German Township Fire Department for a ladder truck.

Prior to the arrival of the ladder truck, firefighters operated handlines into access doors at the base of the silo in an attempt to control the fire close to the bottom of the silo.

Firefighter Garman and Firefighter Jutte responded as a part of the crew on the New Bremen/German Township Fire Department tower ladder quint apparatus.  Upon their arrival on the scene, they helped set up the ladder and bring a member of the New Knoxville Fire Department to the roof of the silo.

Once on the roof, firefighters observed smoke coming from an open roof hatch.  The firefighters returned to the ground.  The decision was made to attempt to extinguish the fire.  A piercing nozzle was inserted through an access door near the ground.  A handline with a cellar (distributing) nozzle from the aerial tower was operated into the roof hatch.  A decision was made to switch from the cellar nozzle to a fog nozzle.  The hose was shut down and removed from the hatch.  Three firefighters were either on the roof of the silo or in the platform of the tower ladder.

As the uncharged hose was removed from the hatch (approximately 80 minutes after the ladder truck arrived on the scene) an explosion occurred.  The force of the explosion ripped the roof of the silo off and damaged the top of the silo.  Pieces of the silo rained down in an area as wide as 100 yards from the base of the silo.  Firefighter Jutte and a New Knoxville firefighter on the roof of the silo were thrown to the ground and Firefighter Garman blown off of the tower ladder platform and fell to the ground.

Firefighters on the scene began to provide medical assistance for the injured and EMS responders were called to the scene.  Several of the victims were transported to the hospital by helicopter.

Firefighter Garman and Firefighter Jutte were killed.  Ten others, including civilians, on the scene were injured.  

Fire investigators concluded that the fire was caused by heat generated by the failure of mechanical equipment in the base of the silo.

"Pilot Black and Forest Unit Supervisor Mackey were involved in a reconnaissance flight to locate water supplies for future fire suppression operations.  They were flying in a Weyerhaeuser-operated Bell 206B helicopter.  The pair located water supply locations that could be utilized by helicopters and recorded their GPS location for future use.

"Engineer Rucker and the members of his engine company were assigned through a statewide mutual aid system to the Cedar Fire near San Diego.  They were assigned to defend a home in a hilly area that was threatened by wind-driver fire spread.Upon their arrival at the home, the crew cleared some brush and decided that the location was defendable.  The crew burned areas of brush near the house and made other preparations for the approach of the fire including laddering the house and stretching hoselines. About 20 minutes after arriving at the house, the engine crew observed an increase in the fire activity below them.  The fire made a one-half mile run directly at Engineer Rucker and his crew in less than 2 minutes. As the fire progressed toward the crew, the firefighters retreated to a defensive position behind the engine and operated 2 handlines for protection.  Fire conditions worsened and the Captain of the crew observed flame lengths of 40-50 feet. Due to the intense heat, the Captain ordered his crew to abandon their position and seek shelter in the house.  The firefighters, facing severe thermal exposure, ran for the shelter of the rear of the house. Two firefighters arrive safely to the interior of the house.  They then heard a radio call indicating that a firefighter was down.  The firefighters left the house and began to retrace their steps back toward the engine.  They encountered the Captain, who told them that Engineer Rucker is down and needed their help.  Due to intense heat, the firefighters and the Captain were unable to go to the aid of Engineer Rucker.

"Lieutenant Harvey and the members of his engine company were dispatched with other companies to the report of a structure fire in a two-story row house.  Upon arrival, Lieutenant Harvey entered the structure without his SCBA to investigate.  

He reported a fire in the basement to the Incident Commander (IC). Lieutenant Harvey ordered the members of his crew to advance a hose line into the front door of the structure. Firefighters reported a very hot and spongy floor as they advanced. Firefighters at the basement door at the rear of the structure were delayed because of accumulated debris. Firefighters operating the handline from Lieutenant Harvey's engine were directed by the IC to prevent the fire from extending into the first floor from the basement. 

Lieutenant Harvey was working inside with his firefighters, still without the benefit of an SCBA. As Lieutenant Harvey exited the structure for a third time, he fell partially through the floor and was trapped. Firefighters from Lieutenant Harvey's crew became concerned when they did not hear from him. One firefighter crawled back toward the front of the home but could not reach the front due to floor failure. Firefighters were able to exit the building through the basement; fire control was being achieved.

Once outside, firefighters informed the IC that Lieutenant Harvey was missing. A rapid intervention crew entered the structure and located Lieutenant Harvey. He was found face down with one leg through a hole in the floor. At this point, approximately 18 minutes had passed since Lieutenant Harvey left his crew. Lieutenant Harvey was removed from the building and transported to the hospital. Lieutenant Harvey suffered from burns on approximately 32% percent of his body, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide inhalation.

After one of the firefighters with Firefighter Fierro experienced a problem with his SCBA, he was forced to exit the building.  The other firefighter with Firefighter Fierro also exited, believing that he had been left alone.

Firefighters and the IC on the exterior of the structure noted structural failure and ordered all firefighters out of the building.  Air horns were sounded to signal the evacuation, and the handline that had been advanced by Firefighter Fierro was pulled from the building.

Firefighters noticed that Firefighter Fierro was missing and initiated searches of the building.

After difficulty in finding the fire, Captain Thornton and another firefighter began to search the upper floor of the residence without a handline.  Captain Thorntonâ019s low air alarm activated.

After firefighters had been on-scene for approximately 20 minutes, fire conditions deteriorated rapidly and trapped Captain Thornton and the firefighter who had accompanied him.  Captain Thornton ran out of air and buddy-breathed with the firefighter.  A second attempt to buddy-breathe was unsuccessful, and Captain Thornton fell to the floor.  The firefighter broke out a window, signaled distress, and went back to find Captain Thornton.  The firefighter was unable to locate Captain Thornton, but was able to find his way out of the structure.

Approximately 20 minutes after his last radio transmission, Captain Thornton was found by firefighters and removed from the structure.  Despite efforts on the scene and at the hospital, Captain Thornton was pronounced dead as a result of smoke inhalation.

Captain Thorntonâ019s air supply was depleted; his PASS device did operate, but the sound was muffled by the position of his body.  The fire was caused by spontaneous combustion of oil-soaked rags that had been stored in the basement of the home.

"Lieutenant Wolff was assigned to an ambulance on August 13, 2006.  The ambulance was dispatched, along with other fire department units, to a structure fire in a residence.  Firefighters arriving on the scene found a working fire with smoke showing.

Lieutenant Wolff and an engineer were ordered to enter the front door of the house and perform a left-hand search.  Another 2-firefighter crew entered and went to the right.  Within minutes of their entry, a partial floor collapse occurred and Lieutenant Wolff and the engineer fell approximately 10 feet into the fully-involved basement.  Maydays were transmitted by Lieutenant Wolff and the engineer.

A second alarm was immediately requested by the incident commander and firefighters began rescue efforts.  The engineer fell into a finished portion of the basement that had windows.  She was assisted through a window by other firefighters.

Lieutenant Wolff fell into a room that did not have windows and his path to an exit was blocked by debris.  Fire conditions advanced markedly after the collapse and firefighters were unable to reach Lieutenant Wolff.  His body was recovered approximately 13 hours into the incident.

The cause of death was listed as asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.  At autopsy, the carboxyhemoglobin level in Lieutenant Wolff's blood was 49.6 percent.  The fire cause is undetermined but it was concluded that the fire burned for some time in the basement prior to its discovery.  The trusses that failed were in the area that was most damaged by fire.

The trusses that failed were TGI trusses, an engineered lumber product.

"Division Supervisor Koyle was on the scene of the lightning-caused Devil's Den wildland fire near Delta, Utah.  He was assigned as the Assistant Fire Management Officer for this incident.

Division Supervisor Koyle and the incident commander were airlifted into the area of the fire at approximately 1230hrs.  After his arrival, Division Supervisor Koyle walked down into the canyon to scout the fire.  After working his way down into the canyon, Division Supervisor Koyle ordered water drops on hot spots.  

Fire conditions worsened dramatically and the incident commander ordered Division Supervisor Koyle to get out of the canyon.  Division Supervisor Koyle began to run from the advancing fire, stopped to deploy his fire shelter, and was overrun by the fire.  The fire shelter was not able to sufficiently protect him and he was fatally burned.

An accident investigation report on the incident citied 4 causal factors in the fatality: 1) Division Supervisor Koyle ignored the incident commander's assessment to stay out of the canyon; 2) Division Supervisor Koyle lost awareness of the fire's blowup potential; 3) Division Supervisor Koyle lost his situational awareness as he focused on directing water drops; and 4) Division Supervisor Koyle violated a number of standard fire fighting orders.",Spencer,Koyle,Stanley,33,Division Supervisor,Wildland Full-Time,17-Aug-06,17-Aug-06,Caught or Trapped,Burns,Support,Yes,On-Scene Fire,Outdoor Property,"Spencer Koyle Memorial Fund at any Wells Fargo Bank in the USA.

"Assistant Chief Miller was the driver and sole occupant of a 1500-gallon water tender that was responding to an arson-caused mutual-aid structure fire.

The water tender entered a 20-degree left-hand curve at a speed estimated at 63 mph.  The posted speed limit for the roadway was 55 mph.  As the apparatus negotiated the curve, the right wheels of the water tender left the paved surface of the road and the vehicle traveled approximately 141 feet on the grassy shoulder.   Assistant Chief Miller overcorrected and brought the water tender back onto the roadway.

The water tender began rotating counter-clockwise, Assistant Chief Miller again overcorrected, the water in the apparatus tank shifted, and the apparatus began to rotate clockwise.  The apparatus eventually left the roadway and rolled 4 times, coming to rest on the driver's side.  Between the second and third rolls of the apparatus, Assistant Chief Miller was ejected.

Assistant Chief Miller received mortal injuries.  Responders provided emergency medical care and he was transported to a hospital.  Assistant Chief Miller was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

The Board of Inquiry believes oxygen entrained within the fire stream together with the infusion of oxygen from the air below the ceiling admitted a fresh supply of oxygen into the ceiling area directly above the kitchen's hood/exhaust duct and into the ceiling void space created by the dislodged ceiling tiles. This event in turn, caused the unburned flammable gas generated by the undetected extended burning fire at that location to ignite.

Firefighter Cahill was unable to exit the kitchen area and died of asphyxiation.  Firefighter Payne died of smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.  Firefighter Payne was found in the seating area of the restaurant.",Warren,Payne,J,53,Firefighter,Career,29-Aug-07,29-Aug-07,Caught or Trapped,Asphyxiation,Advance Hose Lines/Fire Attack (includes Wildland),Yes,On-Scene Fire,Store/Office,Pending

"Captain Broxterman and Firefighter Schira were assigned to Engine 102 along with a fire apparatus operator and another firefighter.  Their unit was dispatched along with other firefighters to the report of a fire in a residence.  Engine 102 was the first fire department unit on the scene and laid a supply line up the extended driveway to the residence.  Captain Broxterman reported moderate smoke showing and established command at 0623hrs.  While donning her protective clothing, Captain Broxterman was advised by her driver that the home's resident said that the fire was in the basement.

Firefighter Schira advanced a 150 foot, 1-3/4 inch handline to the front door of the structure.  Captain Broxterman and Firefighter Schira entered the structure with a dry handline and called for the line to be charged.  Engine 102's other firefighter entered the interior after checking the deployment of the supply line.

At 0627hrs, Captain Broxterman radioed that E102 was making entry into the basement and reported heavy smoke.  After a request for water, the handline was charged at approximately 0629hrs.

"Chief Crotty was in command of an exterior fire at a plastics manufacturing facility.  The aerial ladder on a quint apparatus was set up to help with control of the fire.  When the extended aerial ladder pipe was pressurized, the motorized water monitor and 30 feet of aluminum pipe were projected out the end of the ladder.  The projected assembly struck Chief Crotty and he sustained fatal injuries.

The type of aerial ladder installed on this quint apparatus was capable of operating in a water tower or rescue mode.  In the water tower mode, the shuttle that carried the water monitor and pipe was pinned to the fly section of the ladder to maximize the operating height of the water monitor.  In the rescue mode, the shuttle was pinned to a lower ladder section so that it would not interfere with the placement of the ladder for rescue purposes.  At this incident, the shuttle was not properly secured and was projected off of the ladder when the ladder's water pipe was pressurized.

"Pilot Maris was operating an Air Tractor 602 single engine air tanker.  He had initially declined the mission due to weather and terrain conditions then agreed to proceed to the scene to evaluate conditions.  

Upon arriving at the fire, the pilot tried a dry run in the area where a drop had been requested.  The winds and turbulence were too strong so another drop location was designated.  Pilot Maris made the drop as requested but the aircraft stalled and crashed.

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause(s) of this accident were as follows.  The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control following the jettison of the load during an aerial fire fighting mission, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and impact with terrain.  Contributing to the accident were the improperly configured aircraft for the flight, the gusty wind conditions, and the pressure to complete the mission.

At the completion of the course, firefighters must complete a 2 day practical and written certification test.  Firefighter Topping and other firefighters travelled to the state Professional Skills Center facility near Stillwater for their test.

The day began with a briefing about the events that would occur on the first day of testing.  The outside temperature was 75 degrees Fahrenheit with 69 percent humidity.  This was the hottest day to this point in the year.

"Pitt Township firefighters were initially dispatched to a vehicle fire that was later updated to a garage fire.  Firefighter Kear responded to the fire station and got into the driver's seat of Engine10, a 1991 commercial chassis pumper with a 1,000 gallon water tank.

During the response, Firefighter Kear came upon a farm tractor with implements approaching from the opposite direction.  The tractor pulled as far to the side of the road as possible and stopped.  Firefighter Kear pulled the pumper to the right and passenger side wheels of the apparatus left the roadway.  Firefighter Kear steered left to bring the truck back on the road and the steered to the right when the apparatus jumped toward the opposing lanes.  The rear of the apparatus came around and the apparatus rolled several times.  

Firefighter Kear was no wearing his seatbelt and was ejected during the crash.  A front seat passenger in the apparatus was also not wearing a seatbelt but remained inside of the vehicle.

Firefighter Kear suffered fatal traumatic injuries.  The passenger firefighter received non-life threatening injuries.  The speed of the apparatus prior to the crash was estimated by a witness to be 55 to 60 miles per hour.",Richard,Kear,L.,58,Firefighter,Paid-on-Call,7-Jul-08,7-Jul-08,Vehicle Collision - Includes Aircraft,Trauma,Driving/Operating Vehicle/Apparatus,Yes,Responding,Street/Road,"In honor of Firefighter Richard L.

"At 0540hrs, Maplewood firefighters were dispatched to a report of a vehicle fire.  The units arrived at 0542hrs and reported a vehicle fire and said that they were using a booster line.  At 0546hrs, firefighters reported that they were taking gunfire.  Moments later, firefighters advised that they had a firefighter and a police officer down and were still taking gunfire.

Firefighter Hummert suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was out of reach of the other firefighters on the scene.  From a distance, Firefighter Hummert appeared to have died soon after being shot.

"A fire was reported in the basement of a residential structure.  The first fire department unit on the scene made contact with the homeowner and confirmed that everyone was outside of the home.  Initial arriving fire companies established a water supply and advanced a handline into the basement of the structure.  The crew could not make access to the basement due to debris in the hallway and falling debris.

Smoke from the structure was becoming darker and crews had not located the fire.  A ventilation fan was placed to draw smoke from the basement.  The smoke conditions continued to worsen.

Firefighter Munz responded as a part of an engine company crew as mutual aid.  When his unit arrived on the scene, the incident commander directed them to enter the first floor of the structure to open windows and look for fire extension.  At some point firefighters determined that the floor was softening on the first floor and decided to evacuate the structure.

The first and second members of Firefighter Munz' crew made it out the front door and a collapse occurred.  Firefighter Munz fell into the fire-involved basement of the structure.  Evacuation horns were sounded and firefighters used multiple handlines to attempt to control the fire in Firefighter Munz' location.

Once the fire was knocked down sufficiently to allow entry, a ground ladder was lowered into the hole and firefighters retrieved Firefighter Munz.

Firefighter Munz had expired prior to being removed from the structure.  At autopsy, it was found that Firefighter Munz has first and second degree burns over 50 percent of his body.  His carboxyhemoglobin level was normal.  The cause of death was listed as positional asphyxiation; Firefighter Munz was crushed by debris, principally a couch, and was unable to breathe.

"Chief Wichlacz and other members of his fire department had just returned to their station after fighting a structure fire.  Firefighters were in the process of returning equipment to service and refilling apparatus water tanks.

A firefighter's pickup truck was blocking one of the rear bay doors at the fire station.  Another firefighter received permission from the owner to move the pickup.  The firefighter intended to back the pickup away from the bay and relocate the pickup to a bay just to the right the original bay to allow access.  The firefighter got into the pickup wearing bunker pants and wet rubber boots.

As the pickup was pulled forward, it unexpectedly accelerated and struck the bay door.  Chief Wichlacz happened to be walking through the area at that moment and was crushed between the front of the pickup and the rear of a tanker (tender) parking in the bay.

Chief Wichlacz was quickly removed and transported by ambulance to the hospital.  He was pronounced dead at the hospital.  The cause of death was listed as blunt trauma to the chest.

After working logistical assignments at the camp, Firefighter Palmer and his crew were assigned to a tree falling team.  The team worked ahead of firefighters mopping up a fire that was under control.  The falling team removed or dropped hazardous tress to allow other firefighters to work more safely.

At approximately 1350hrs, Firefighter Palmer was injured by a falling tree.  Helicopter access to the site was prevented by smoke conditions so other firefighters carried Firefighter Palmer to a location where he was picked up by a United States Coast Guard helicopter.

"Captain Hall and Firefighter Specialist Quinones were working at Los Angeles County Fire Department Mount Gleason Fire Camp 16 along with California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation inmate firefighters.  The Station Fire was ongoing in the area and there was a plan to defend in place if the fire threatened the camp.

A planned firing operation was conducted on a slope below the camp.  Firefighters at the camp were sheltered in the dining hall and firefighters were positioned for structure protection.  The fire behaved in a manner that was not predicted and attacked the camp.  Flame fronts of over 200 feet reached the camp.  Firefighters were ordered to abandon the dining hall, which caught fire, and move to vehicles.  These vehicles were moved to an area of the camp where the fire had already passed.  An accountability report revealed that Captain Hall and Firefighter Specialist Quinones were not accounted for.

Captain Hall and Firefighter Specialist Quinones had been assigned as the firing team.  Their vehicle was discovered approximately 800 feet off of the road in a ravine.  Both were deceased.  The autopsies of both firefighters listed the cause of death as multiple trauma.

"Five fire departments, including the Eastland Volunteer Fire Department, were dispatched to a wildland fire located to the south of the city limits of Eastland.  Firefighter Simmons drove a brush truck to the incident along with another firefighter.

The Eastland brush truck joined other units and attacked the eastern flank of the fire from the unburned area.  Access to the area was provided by a single gate from a roadway.  A wind shift drove the fire toward firefighters, forcing an immediate evacuation of the area.

As apparatus left the area, firefighters on the first brush trucks to escape yelled to firefighters staged by the roadway to evacuate immediately.  A brush truck stopped at the gate and was abandoned by the firefighters assigned to it.  This blocked the escape path for Firefighter Simmons and the other firefighter on his apparatus.  Both firefighters abandoned their vehicle and ran to the roadway to escape the fire.  The firefighters were separated during the escape.

After the fire passed, Firefighter Simmons was discovered deceased in a ditch.  Initial assumptions were that he died due to fire exposure injuries.  During the autopsy, it was discovered that Firefighter Simmons died of blunt trauma.  He was apparently run over by one of the fire vehicles leaving the scene as the fire approached and passed.

"Firefighter Davis and the members of his fire department were dispatched to a report of a fire in a large church.  First arriving firefighters reported visible flames and heavy smoke coming from the roof.  The first arriving company officer called for a second alarm and shortly thereafter special called additional tankers (tenders).

Firefighters entered the structure and found mostly clear conditions in the interior of the church.  As firefighters began to open up the ceilings to access the attic space, they discovered a considerable amount of fire.  Interior crews were having difficulty controlling the fire with a handline.  Water supply was an issue; the area of the church did not have fire hydrants.

Interior firefighters notified the incident commander that they were withdrawing from the structure.  As firefighters were preparing to leave, a structural collapse occurred.  An accountability check was conducted and it was realized that Firefighter Davis was missing.

Due to the volume of fire, firefighters were unable to access the collapsed area.  Firefighter Davis was located when a news helicopter flying over the scene spotted his remains in the debris.  The cause of death was listed as smoke inhalation.  The origin of the fire was likely a lightning strike earlier in the day.

The fire fight was in a defensive mode with no interior fire fighting operations.  The fire had self-vented and cracks were visible in at least one exterior wall.  It was noted that an extension ladder was against the building in an area that would be subject to collapse.

"At 1735hrs, the Perry Fire Department was paged for a grass fire / abandoned structure fire.   Captain King and all Perry Fire Department members were paged to respond through an all-call.  
At 1736hrs, a local weather station reported a temperature of 104.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

When first responding firefighters arrived on the scene, they found a grass fire that had spread to an abandoned house.  Captain King and another fire officer responded in Engine 6 to the scene.  They arrived at 1758hrs and immediately began to attack the structure fire.  Captain King and the other fire officer advanced a 100-foot 1-3/4 inch attack line.  Both firefighters were wearing full structural fire fighting protective clothing and SCBA.

The fire was called under control at 1822hrs.  Captain King and other firefighters continued to work to overhaul the structure and extinguish hot spots.  A short time later, all firefighters on the scene gathered at the rear of the structure to take a break and hydrate.  Firefighters had taken off their coats to cool off and drink some fluids.   After about 10 minutes, firefighters began to put their protective clothing on to go back to work.  As Captain King began to put his helmet on, he collapsed face first to the ground.

Firefighters began to provide immediate medical assistance.  Captain King was found to be pulse less and not breathing.  An ambulance and medical helicopter were requested.  CPR was begun.

The ambulance was dispatched at 1825hrs and arrived on scene at 1840hrs.  Captain King was immediately loaded in the ambulance and an AED was attached.   Captain King was transported to a local hospital.  Due to his condition, Captain King was then transported by helicopter to a regional hospital in Oklahoma City.  Captain King never regained consciousness and died in the hospital on August 7, 2011.

"Lieutenant Oliveira was responsible for vehicle maintenance and fleet management for Salisbury Fire Rescue.  He was making preparations to change the oil on a fire department SUV in the parking lot behind the fire station.

Apparently, Lieutenant Oliveira lifted the vehicle with a portable hydraulic floor jack in preparation to perform the oil change.  He used a creeper to get under the vehicle.  At some point, the floor jack allowed the vehicle to lower on top of Lieutenant Oliveira.  Firefighters came outside to check on Lieutenant Oliveira and found him pinned and unconscious.

The vehicle was lifted again utilizing the floor jack.  The jack failed.  Firefighters used a hydraulic rescue tool to lift the vehicle off of Lieutenant Oliveira.  He was removed from under the vehicle and transported to the hospital by ambulance.  He later died at the hospital.  The cause of death was listed as asphyxiation due to compression of the torso.

"Houston Fire Department units were dispatched to a report of a fire in a motel.  Captain Renaud and Engineer Operator Bebee were on the first engine to arrive at the scene.  Firefighters found a working fire with heavy smoke showing and advanced a 2-1/2 inch handline into the structure.  Firefighters opened the ceiling as they advanced and found fire in the space above.  Firefighters were ordered to withdraw from the structure while a water supply was secured.  
<p>
Once a water supply was established, firefighters advanced into the structure.  Firefighters Garner and Sullivan, from the second engine to arrive on-scene, backed up other firefighters.  As firefighters advanced, a structural collapse occurred and trapped a number of firefighters.  Four firefighters were killed as a result of the collapse and over a dozen were injured, including a Captain received severe injuries.
<p> 
Autopsy examinations revealed the firefighters died from thermal injuries, smoke inhalation, and compressional asphyxia.

<p>
From the Serious Accident Investigation Report, released September 23, 2013:
<p>
Late afternoon on June 28, the Yarnell Hill Fire started high on a ridge west of Yarnell, Arizona when lightning ignited multiple fires. The fire, which was under the jurisdiction of the Arizona State Forestry Division, started in a boulder field in steep terrain with no vehicle access; it was about one-half acre in size. Responders saw minimal fire activity or spread potential, and they had several safety concerns with putting firefighters on the hill overnight. In consideration of these and other factors, the Incident Commander prepared for full suppression on the following morning. 
<p>
On June 29, resources held the fire in check until around 1600, when winds increased and the fire spotted outside containment lines. That evening, the Type 4 Incident Commander ordered a Type 2 Incident Management Team (IMT) and additional resources for the next morning. The fire grew throughout the night, to an estimated 300 to 500 acres by morning. 
<p>
Early on June 30, members of the Type 2 IMT began arriving. In a briefing at 0700, the incoming Granite Mountain IHC Superintendent accepted the role of Division Alpha Supervisor. His assignment was to establish an anchor point at the heel of the fire with the Granite Mountain IHC. The Type 2 IMT assumed command, an action formally announced by radio at 1022. 
<p>
For most of the day, the fire spread to the northeast, threatening structures in Model Creek and Peeples Valley. Around 1550, the wind shifted and the fire started pushing aggressively to the southeast, toward Yarnell. Fire resources shifted to resident evacuation and structure protection in town. 
<p>
Only the Granite Mountain IHC remained out on the ridge, on the southwest perimeter of the fire. Personnel who communicated with the Granite Mountain IHC knew the crew was in the black at that time and assumed they would stay there. No one realized that the crew left the black and headed southeast, sometime after 1604. At 1630, thunderstorm outflows reached the southern perimeter of the fire. Winds increased substantially; the fire turned south and overran the Granite Mountain IHC at about 1642.

Late afternoon on June 28, the Yarnell Hill Fire started high on a ridge west of Yarnell, Arizona when lightning ignited multiple fires. The fire, which was under the jurisdiction of the Arizona State Forestry Division, started in a boulder field in steep terrain with no vehicle access; it was about one-half acre in size. Responders saw minimal fire activity or spread potential, and they had several safety concerns with putting firefighters on the hill overnight. In consideration of these and other factors, the Incident Commander prepared for full suppression on the following morning. 
<p>
On June 29, resources held the fire in check until around 1600, when winds increased and the fire spotted outside containment lines. That evening, the Type 4 Incident Commander ordered a Type 2 Incident Management Team (IMT) and additional resources for the next morning. The fire grew throughout the night, to an estimated 300 to 500 acres by morning. 
<p>
Early on June 30, members of the Type 2 IMT began arriving. In a briefing at 0700, the incoming Granite Mountain IHC Superintendent accepted the role of Division Alpha Supervisor. His assignment was to establish an anchor point at the heel of the fire with the Granite Mountain IHC. The Type 2 IMT assumed command, an action formally announced by radio at 1022. 
<p>
For most of the day, the fire spread to the northeast, threatening structures in Model Creek and Peeples Valley. Around 1550, the wind shifted and the fire started pushing aggressively to the southeast, toward Yarnell. Fire resources shifted to resident evacuation and structure protection in town. 
<p>
Only the Granite Mountain IHC remained out on the ridge, on the southwest perimeter of the fire. Personnel who communicated with the Granite Mountain IHC knew the crew was in the black at that time and assumed they would stay there. No one realized that the crew left the black and headed southeast, sometime after 1604. At 1630, thunderstorm outflows reached the southern perimeter of the fire. Winds increased substantially; the fire turned south and overran the Granite Mountain IHC at about 1642.

As the Deputy Sheriff made a left-hand turn toward the incident scene, Chief Yates also turned left and entered the intersection at the same time as the law enforcement officer.  The vehicles collided and Chief Yates’ vehicle entered a ditch, struck a driveway embankment, and rolled.  Chief Yates was ejected from his vehicle and ended up trapped under his vehicle.  Chief Yates’ vehicle then caught fire.

The fire was controlled and Chief Yates was extricated.  Chief Yates was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash and his death was caused by traumatic injuries.
